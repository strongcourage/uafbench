File: recutils.info,  Node: Purpose,  Next: A Little Example,  Up: Introduction

1.1 Purpose
===========

GNU recutils is a set of tools and libraries to access human-editable,
text-based databases called _recfiles_.  The data is stored as a
sequence of records, each record containing an arbitrary number of named
fields.  Advanced capabilities usually found in other data storage
systems are supported: data types, data integrity (keys, mandatory
fields, etc.) as well as the ability of records to refer to other
records (sort of foreign keys).  Despite its simplicity, recfiles can be
used to store medium-sized databases.

   So, yet another data storage system?  The mere existence of this
package deserves an explanation.  There is a rich set of already
available free data storage systems, covering a broad range of
requirements.  Big systems having complex data storage requirements will
probably make use of some full-fledged relational system such as MySQL
or PostgreSQL.  Less demanding applications, or applications with
special deployment requirements, may find it more convenient to use a
simpler system such as SQLite, where the data is stored in a single
binary file.  XML files are often used to store configuration settings
for programs, and to encode data for transmission through networks.

   So it looks like all the needs are covered by the existing solutions
... but consider the following characteristics of the data storage
systems mentioned in the previous paragraph:

   - The stored data is not directly human readable.
   - The stored data is definitely not directly writable by humans.
   - They are program dependent.
   - They are not easily managed by version control systems.

   Regarding the first point (human readability), while it is clearly
true for the binary files, some may argue XML files are indeed human
readable... well... '<bar><foo tag="val">try</foo> to r&iamp;ead
<p>this</p></bar>'.  YAML (1) is an example of a hierarchical data
storage format which is much more readable than XML.  The problem with
YAML is that it was designed as a "data serialization language" and thus
to map the data constructs usually found in programming languages.  That
makes it too complex for the simple task of storing plain lists of
items.

   Recfiles are human-readable, human-writable and still easy to parse
and to manipulate automatically.  Obviously they are not suitable for
any task (for example, it can be difficult to manage hierarchies in
recfiles) and performance is somewhat sacrificed in favor of
readability.  But they are quite handy to store small to medium simple
databases.

   The GNU recutils suite comprises:

   - This Texinfo manual, describing the Rec format and the accompanying
     software.
   - A C library (librec) that provides a rich set of functions to
     manipulate rec data.
   - A set utilities that can be used in shell scripts and in the
     command line to operate on rec files.
   - An emacs mode, 'rec-mode'.

   (1) Yet Another Markup Language


File: recutils.info,  Node: A Little Example,  Prev: Purpose,  Up: Introduction

1.2 A Little Example
====================

Everyone loves to grow a nice book collection at home.  Unfortunately,
in most cases the management of our private books gets uncontrolled:
some books get lost, some of them may be loaned to some friend, there
are some duplicated (or even triplicated!)  titles because we forgot
about the existence of the previous copy, and many more details.

   In order to improve the management of our little book collection we
could make use of a complex data storage system such as a relational
database.  The problem with that approach, as explained in the previous
section, is that the tool is too complicated for the simple task: we do
not need the full power of a relational database system to maintain a
simple collection of books.

   With GNU recutils it is possible to maintain such a little database
in a text file.  Let's call it 'books.rec'.  The following table resumes
the information items that we want to store for each title, along with
some common-sense restrictions.

   - Every book has a title, even if it is "No Title".
   - A book can have several titles.
   - A book can have more than one author.
   - For some books the author is not known.
   - Sometimes we don't care about who the author of a book is.
   - We usually store our books at home.
   - Sometimes we loan books to friends.
   - On occasions we lose track of the physical location of a book.  Did
     we loan it to anyone?  Was it lost in the last move?  Is it in some
     hidden place at home?

The contents of the rec file follows:

     # -*- mode: rec -*-

     %rec: Book
     %mandatory: Title
     %type: Location enum loaned home unknown
     %doc:
     + A book in my personal collection.

     Title: GNU Emacs Manual
     Author: Richard M. Stallman
     Publisher: FSF
     Location: home

     Title: The Colour of Magic
     Author: Terry Pratchett
     Location: loaned

     Title: Mio Cid

     Author: Jose E. Marchesi

     Title: Yeelong User Manual
     Location: home

     # End of books.rec

   Simple.  The file contains a set of records separated by blank lines.
Each record comprises a set of fields with a name and a value.

   The GNU recutils can then be used to access the contents of the file.
For example, we could get a list of the names of loaned books by
invoking 'recsel' in the following way:

     $ recsel -e "Location = 'loaned'" -P Title books.rec
     The Colour of Magic

2 The Rec Format
****************

A recfile is nothing but a text file which conforms to a few simple
rules.  This chapter shows you how, by observing these rules, recfiles
of arbitrary complexity can be written.

* Menu:

* Fields::                    The key-value pairs which comprise the data.
* Records::                   The main entities of a recfile.
* Comments::                  Information for humans' benefit only.
* Record Descriptors::        Describing different types of records.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Fields,  Next: Records,  Up: The Rec Format

2.1 Fields
==========

A "field" is the written form of an association between a label and a
value.  For example, if we wanted to associate the label 'Name' with the
value 'Ada Lovelace' we would write:

     Name: Ada Lovelace

   The separator between the field name and the field value is a colon
followed by a blank character (space and tabs, but not newlines).  The
name of the field shall begin in the first column of the line.

   A "field name" is a sequence of alphanumeric characters plus
underscores ('_'), starting with a letter or the character '%'.  The
regular expression denoting a field name is:

     [a-zA-Z%][a-zA-Z0-9_]*

   Field names are case-sensitive.  'Foo' and 'foo' are different field
names.

   The following list contains valid field names (the final colon is not
part of the names):

     Foo:
     foo:
     A23:
     ab1:
     A_Field:

   The "value of a field" is a sequence of characters terminated by a
single newline character ('\n').

   Sometimes a value is too long to fit in the usual width of terminals
and screens.  In that case, depending on the specific tool used to
access the file, the readability of the data would not be that good.  It
is therefore possible to physically split a logical line by escaping a
newline with a backslash character, as in:

     LongLine: This is a quite long value \
     comprising a single unique logical line \
     split in several physical lines.

   The sequence '\n' (newline) '+' (PLUS) and an optional '_' (SPACE) is
interpreted as a newline when found in a field value.  For example, the
C string '"bar1\nbar2\n bar3"' would be encoded in the following way in
a field value:

     Foo: bar1
     + bar2
     +  bar3


File: recutils.info,  Node: Records,  Next: Comments,  Prev: Fields,  Up: The Rec Format

2.2 Records
===========

A "record" is a group of one or more fields written one after the other:

     Name1: Value1
     Name2: Value2
     Name2: Value3

   It is possible for several fields in a record to share the same name
or/and the field value.  The following is a valid record containing
three fields:

     Name: John Smith
     Email: john.smith@foomail.com
     Email: john@smith.name

   The "size of a record" is defined as the number of fields that it
contains.  A record cannot be empty, so the minimum size for a record is
1.  The maximum number of fields for a record is only limited by the
available physical resources.  The size of the previous record is 3.

   Records are separated by one or more blank lines.  For instance, the
following example shows a file named 'personalities.rec' featuring three
records:

     Name: Ada Lovelace
     Age: 36

     Name: Peter the Great
     Age: 53

     Name: Matusalem
     Age: 969


File: recutils.info,  Node: Comments,  Next: Record Descriptors,  Prev: Records,  Up: The Rec Format

2.3 Comments
============

Any line having an '#' (ASCII 0x23) character in the first column is a
comment line.

   Comments may be used to insert information that is not part of the
database but useful in other ways.  They are completely ignored by
processing tools and can only be seen by looking at the recfile itself.

   It is also quite convenient to comment-out information from the
recfile without having to remove it in a definitive way: you may want to
recover the data into the database later!  Comment lines can be used to
comment-out both full registers and single fields:

     Name: Jose E. Marchesi
     # Occupation: Software Engineer
     # Severe lack of brain capacity
     # Fired on 02/01/2009 (without compensation)
     Occupation: Unoccupied

   Comments are also useful for headers, footers, comment blocks and all
kind of markers:

     # -*- mode: rec -*-
     #
     # TODO
     #
     # This file contains the Bugs database of GNU recutils.
     #
     # Blah blah...

     ...

     # End of TODO

   Unlike some file formats, comments in recfiles must be complete
lines.  You cannot start a comment in the middle of a line.  For
example, in the following record, the '#' does _not_ start a comment:
     Name: Peter the Great # Russian Tsar
     Age: 53


File: recutils.info,  Node: Record Descriptors,  Prev: Comments,  Up: The Rec Format

2.4 Record Descriptors
======================

Certain properties of a set of records can be specified by preceding
them with a "record descriptor".  A record descriptor is itself a
record, and uses fields with some predefined names to store properties.

* Menu:

* Record Sets::               Defining different types of records.
* Naming Record Types::       Some conventions on naming record sets.
* Documenting Records::       Documenting your record sets.
* Record Sets Properties::    Introducing the special fields.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Record Sets,  Next: Naming Record Types,  Up: Record Descriptors

2.4.1 Record Sets
-----------------

The most basic property that can be specified for a set of records is
their "type".  The special field name '%rec' is used for that purpose:

     %rec: Entry

     Id: 1
     Name: Entry 1

     Id: 2
     Name: Entry 2

   The records following the descriptors are then identified as having
its type.  So in the example above we would say there are two records of
type "Entry".  Or in a more colloquial way we would say there are two
"Entries" in the database.

   The effect of a record descriptor ends when another descriptor is
found in the stream of records.  This allows you to store different
kinds of records in the same database.  For example, suppose you are
maintaining a depot.  You will need to keep track of both what items are
available and when they are sold or restocked.

   The following example shows the usage of two record descriptors to
store both kind of records: articles and stock.

     %rec: Article

     Id: 1
     Title: Article 1

     Id: 2
     Title: Article 2

     %rec: Stock

     Id: 1
     Type: sell
     Date: 20 April 2011

     Id: 2
     Type: stock
     Date: 21 April 2011

   The collection of records having same types in recfiles are known as
"record sets" in recutils jargon.  In the example above two record sets
are defined: one containing articles and the other containing stock
movements.

   Nothing prevents having empty record sets in databases.  This is in
fact usually the case when a new recfile is written but no data exists
yet.  In our depot example we could write a first version of the
database containing just the record descriptors:

     %rec: Article

     %rec: Stock

   Special records are not required, and many recfiles do not have them.
This is because all the records contained in the file are of the same
type, and their nature can usually be inferred from both the file name
and their contents.  For example, 'contacts.rec' could simply contain
records representing contacts without an explicit '%rec: Contact' record
descriptor.  In this case we say that the type of the anonymous records
stored in the file is the "default record type".

   Another possible situation, although not usual, is to have a recfile
containing both non-typed (default) and typed record types:

     Id: 1
     Title: Blah

     Id: 2
     Title: Bleh

     %rec: Movement

     Date: 13-Aug-2012
     Concept: 20

     Date: 24-Sept-2012
     Concept: 12

In this case the records preceding the movements are of the "default"
type, whereas the records following the record descriptor are of type
'Movement'.  Even though it is supported by the format and the
utilities, it is generally not recommended to mix non-typed and typed
records in a recfile.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Naming Record Types,  Next: Documenting Records,  Prev: Record Sets,  Up: Record Descriptors

2.4.2 Naming Record Types
-------------------------

It is up to you how to name your record sets.  Any string comprising
only alphanumeric characters or underscores, and that starts with a
letter will be a legal name.  However, it is recommended to use the
singular form of a noun in order to describe the "type" of the records
in the records set.  Examples are 'Article', 'Contributor', 'Employee'
and 'Movement'.

   The used noun should be specific enough in order to characterize the
property of the records which matters.  For example, in a contributor's
database it would be better to have a record set named 'Contributor'
than 'Person'.

   The reason of using singular nouns instead of their plural forms is
that it works better with the utilities: it is more natural to read
'recsel -t Contributor' ('-t' is for "type") than 'recsel -t
Contributors'.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Documenting Records,  Next: Record Sets Properties,  Prev: Naming Record Types,  Up: Record Descriptors

2.4.3 Documenting Records
-------------------------

As well as a name, it is a good idea to provide a description of the
record set.  This is sometimes called the record set's "documentation"
and is specified using the '%doc' field.

   Whereas the name is usually short and can contain only alphanumeric
characters and underscores, no such restriction applies to the
documentation.  The documentation is typically more verbose than the
name provided by the '%rec' field and may contain arbitrary characters
such as punctuation and parentheses.  It is somewhat similar to a
comment (*note Comments::), but it can be managed more easily in a
programmatic way.  Unlike a comment, the '%doc' field is recognized by
tools such as 'recinf' (*note Invoking recinf::) which processes record
descriptors.  For example, you might have two record sets with '%rec'
and '%doc' fields as follows:

     %rec: Contact
     %doc: Family, friends and acquaintances (other than business).

     Name: Granny
     Phone: +12 23456677

     Name: Edwina
     Phone: +55 0923 8765


     %rec: Associate
     %doc: Colleagues and other business contacts

     Name: Karl Schmidt
     Phone: +49 88234566

     Name: Genevieve Curie
     Phone: +33 34 87 65


File: recutils.info,  Node: Record Sets Properties,  Prev: Documenting Records,  Up: Record Descriptors

2.4.4 Record Sets Properties
----------------------------

Besides determining the type of record that follows in the stream,
record descriptors can be used to describe other properties of those
records.  This can be done by using "special fields", which have special
names from a predefined set.  Consider for example the following
database, where record descriptors are used to specify a (optional)
numeric 'Id' and a mandatory 'Title' field:

     %rec: Item
     %type: Id int
     %mandatory: Title

     Id: 10
     Title: Notebook (big)

     Id: 11
     Title: Fountain Pen

   Note that the names of special fields always start with the character
'%'.  Also note that it is also possible to use non-special fields in a
record descriptor, but such fields will have no effect on the described
record set.

   Every record set must contain one, and only one, field named '%rec'.
It is not mandated that that field must occupy the first position in the
record.  However, it is considered a good style to place it as the first
field in the record set, in order for the casual reader to easily
identify the type of the records.

   The following list briefly describes the special fields defined in
the recutils format, along with references to the sections of this
manual describing their usage in depth.

3 Querying Recfiles
*******************

Since recfiles are always human readable, you could lookup data simply
by opening an editor and searching for the desired information.  Or you
could use a standard tool such as 'grep' to extract strings matching a
pattern.  However, recutils provides a more powerful and flexible way to
lookup data.  The following sections explore how the recutils can be
used in order to extract data from recfiles, from very basic and simple
queries to quite complex examples.

3.1 Simple Selections
=====================

'recsel' is an utility whose primary purpose is to select records from a
recfile and print them on standard output.  Consider the following
example record set, which we shall assume is saved in a recfile called
'acquaintances.rec':

     # This database contains a list of both real and fictional people
     # along with their age.

     Name: Ada Lovelace
     Age: 36

     Name: Peter the Great
     Age: 53

     # Name: Matusalem
     # Age: 969

     Name: Bart Simpson
     Age: 10

     Name: Adrian Mole
     Age: 13.75

If we invoke 'recsel acquaintances.rec' we will get a list of all the
records stored in the file in the terminal:

     $ recsel acquaintances.rec
     Name: Ada Lovelace
     Age: 36

     Name: Peter the Great
     Age: 53

     Name: Bart Simpson
     Age: 10

     Name: Adrian Mole
     Age: 13.75

Note that the commented out parts of the file, in this case the
explanatory header and the record corresponding to Matusalem, are not
part of the output produced by 'recsel'.  This is because 'recsel' is
concerned only with the data.

   'recsel' will also "pack" the records so any extra empty lines that
may be between records are not echoed in the output:

     *acquaintances.rec:*                 $ recsel acquaintances.rec
                                          Name: Peter the Great
     Name: Peter the Great                Age: 53
     Age: 53                         
                                          Name: Bart Simpson
     # Note the extra empty lines.        Age: 10


     Name: Bart Simpson
     Age: 10

It is common to store data gathered in several recfiles.  For example,
we could have a 'contacts.rec' file containing general contact records,
and also a 'work-contacts.rec' file containing business contacts:

     *contacts.rec:*                      *work-contacts.rec:*
                                     
     Name: Granny                         Name: Yoyodyne Corp.
     Phone: +12 23456677                  Email: sales@yoyod.com
                                          Phone: +98 43434433
     Name: Doctor                    
     Phone: +12 58999222                  Name: Robert Harris
                                          Email: robert.harris@yoyod.com
                                          Note: Sales Department.

   Both files can be passed to 'recsel' in the command line.  In that
case 'recsel' will simply process them and output their records in the
same order they were specified:

     $ recsel contacts.rec work-contacts.rec
     Name: Granny
     Phone: +12 23456677

     Name: Doctor
     Phone: +12 58999222

     Name: Yoyodyne Corp.
     Email: sales@yoyod.com
     Phone: +98 43434433

     Name: Robert Harris
     Email: robert.harris@yoyod.com
     Note: Sales Department.

As mentioned above, the output follows the ordering on the command line,
so 'recsel work-contacts.rec contacts.rec' would output the records of
'work-contacts.rec' first and then the ones from 'contacts.rec'.

Note however that 'recsel' will merge records from several files
specified in the command line only if they are anonyomuse.  If the
contacts in our files were typed:

     *contacts.rec:*                      *work-contacts.rec:*
                                     
     %rec: Contact                        %rec: Contact
                                     
     Name: Granny                         Name: Yoyodyne Corp.
     Phone: +12 23456677                  Email: sales@yoyod.com
                                          Phone: +98 43434433
     Name: Doctor                    
     Phone: +12 58999222                  Name: Robert Harris
                                          Email: robert.harris@yoyod.com
                                          Note: Sales Department.

Then we would get the following error message:

     $ recsel contacts.rec work-contacts.rec
     recsel: error: duplicated record set 'Contact' from work-contacts.rec.

3.2 Selecting by Type
=====================

As we saw in the section discussing record descriptors, it is possible
to have several different types of records in a single recfile.
Consider for example a 'gnu.rec' file containing information about
maintainers and packages in the GNU Project:

     %rec: Maintainer

     Name: Jose E. Marchesi
     Email: jemarch@gnu.org

     Name: Luca Saiu
     Email: positron@gnu.org

     %rec: Package

     Name: GNU recutils
     LastRelease: 12 February 2014

     Name: GNU epsilon
     LastRelease: 10 March 2013

If 'recsel' is invoked in that file it will complain:

     $ recsel gnu.rec
     recsel: error: several record types found.  Please use -t to specify one.

This is because 'recsel' does not know which records to output: the
maintainers or the packages.  This can be resolved by using the '-t'
command line option:

     $ recsel -t Package gnu.rec
     Name: GNU recutils
     LastRelease: 12 February 2014

     Name: GNU epsilon
     LastRelease: 10 March 2013

By default 'recsel' never outputs record descriptors.  This is because
most of the time the user is only interested in the data.  However, with
the '-d' command line option, the record descriptor of the selected type
is printed preceding the data records:

     $ recsel -d -t Maintainer gnu.rec
     %rec: Maintainer

     Name: Jose E. Marchesi
     Email: jemarch@gnu.org

     Name: Luca Saiu
     Email: positron@gnu.org

Note that at the moment it is not possible to select non-typed (default)
records when other record sets are stored in the same file.  This is one
of the reasons why mixing non-typed records and typed records in a
single recfile is not recommended.

Note also that if a nonexistent record type is specified in '-t' then
'recsel' does nothing.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Selecting by Position,  Next: Random Records,  Prev: Selecting by Type,  Up: Querying Recfiles

3.3 Selecting by Position
=========================

As was explained in the previous sections, 'recsel' outputs all the
records of some record set.  The records are echoed in the same order
they are written in the recfile.  However, often it is desirable to
select a subset of the records, determined by the position they occupy
in their record set.

   The '-n' command line option to 'recsel' supports doing this in a
natural way.  This is how we would retrieve the first contact listed in
a contacts database using 'recsel':

     $ recsel -n 0 contacts.rec
     Name: Granny
     Phone: +12 23456677

Note that the index is zero-based.  If we want to retrieve more records
we can specify several indexes to '-n' separated by commas.  If a given
index is too big, it is simply ignored:

     $ recsel -n 0,1,999 contacts.rec
     Name: Granny
     Phone: +12 23456677

     Name: Doctor
     Phone: +12 58999222

With '-n', the order in which the records are echoed does not depend on
the order of the indexes passed to '-n'.  For example, the output of
'recsel -n 0,1' will be identical to the output of 'recsel -n 1,0'.

   Ranges of indexes can also be used to select a subset of the records.
For example, the following call would also select the first three
contacts of the database:

     $ recsel -n 0-2 contacts.rec
     Name: Granny
     Phone: +12 23456677

     Name: Doctor
     Phone: +12 58999222

     Name: Dad
     Phone: +12 88229900

It is possible to mix single indexes and index ranges in the same call.
For example, 'recsel -n 0,5-6' would select the first, sixth and seventh
records.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Random Records,  Next: Selection Expressions,  Prev: Selecting by Position,  Up: Querying Recfiles

3.4 Random Records
==================

Consider a database in which each record is a cooking recipe.  It is
always difficult to decide what to cook each day, so it would be nice if
we could ask 'recsel' to pick up a random recipe.  This can be achieved
using the '-m' ('--random') command line option of 'recsel':

     $ recsel -m 1 recipes.rec
     Title: Curry chicken
     Ingredient: A whole chicken
     Ingredient: Curry
     Preparation: ...

If we need two recipes, because we will be cooking at both lunch and
dinner, we can pass a different number to '-m':

     $ recsel -m 2 recipes.rec
     Title: Fabada Asturiana
     Ingredient: 300 gr of fabes.
     Ingredient: Chorizo
     Ingredient: Morcilla
     Preparation: ...

     Title: Pasta with ragu
     Ingredient: 500 gr of spaghetti.
     Ingredient: 2 tomatoes.
     Ingredient: Minced meat.
     Preparation: ...

The algorithm used to implement '-m' guarantees that you will never get
multiple instances of the same record.  This means that if a record set
has N records and you ask for N random records, you will get all the
records in a random order.

3.5 Selection Expressions
=========================

"Selection expressions", also known as "sexes" in recutils jargon, are
infix expressions that can be applied to a record.  A "sex" is a
predicate which selects a subset of records within a recfile.  They can
be simple expressions involving just one operator and a pair of
operands, or complex compound expressions with parenthetical
sub-expressions and many operators and operands.  One of their most
common uses is to examine records matching a particular set of
conditions.

* Menu:

* Selecting by predicate:: Selecting records which satisfy conditions.
* SEX Operands::        Literal values, fields and sub-expressions.
* SEX Operators::       Arithmetic, logical and other operators.
* SEX Evaluation::      Selection expressions are like generators.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Selecting by predicate,  Next: SEX Operands,  Up: Selection Expressions

3.5.1 Selecting by predicate
----------------------------

Consider the example recfile 'acquaintances.rec' introduced earlier.  It
contains names of people along with their respective ages.  Suppose we
want to get a list of the names of all the children.  It would not be
easy to do this using 'grep'.  Neither would it, for any reasonably
large recfile, be feasible to search manually for the children.
Fortunately the 'recsel' command provides an easy way to do such a
lookup:
     $ recsel -e "Age < 18" -P Name acquaintances.rec
     Bart Simpson
     Adrian Mole

Let us look at each of the arguments to 'recsel' in turn.  Firstly we
have '-e' which tells 'recsel' to lookup records matching the expression
'Age < 18' -- in other words all those people whose ages are less than
18.  This is an example of a "selection expression".  In this case it is
a simple test, but it can be as complex as needed.

   Next, there is '-P' which tells 'recsel' to print out the value of
the 'Name' field -- because we want just the name, not the entire
record.  The final argument is the name of the file from whence the
records are to come: 'acquaintances.rec'.

   Rather than explicitly storing ages in the recfile, a more realistic
example might have the date of birth instead (otherwise it would be
necessary to update the people's ages in the recfile on every birthday).

     # Date of Birth
     %type: Dob date

     Name: Alfred Nebel
     Dob: 20 April 2010
     Email: alf@example.com

     Name: Bertram Worcester
     Dob: 3 January 1966
     Email: bert@example.com

     Name: Charles Spencer
     Dob: 4 July 1997
     Email: charlie@example.com

     Name: Dirk Hogart
     Dob: 29 June 1945
     Email: dirk@example.com

     Name: Ernest Wright
     Dob: 26 April 1978
     Email: ernie@example.com

Now we can achieve a similar result as before, by looking up the names
of all those people who were born after a particular date:
     $ recfix acquaintances.rec
     $ recsel -e "Dob >> '31 July 1994'" -p Name acquaintances.rec
     Name: Alfred Nebel
     Name: Charles Spencer

The '>>' operator means "later than", and is used here to select a date
of birth after 31st July 1994.  Note also that this example uses a lower
case '-p' whereas the preceding example used the upper case '-P'.  The
difference is that '-p' prints the field name and field value, whereas
'-P' prints just the value.

   'recsel' accepts more than one '-e' argument, each introducing a
selection expression, in which case the records which satisfy all
expressions are selected.  You can provide more than one field label to
'-P' or '-p' in order to select additional fields to be displayed.  For
example, if you wanted to send an email to all children 14 to 18 years
of age, and today's date were 1st August 2012, then you could use the
following command to get the name and email address of all such
children:

     $ recfix acquaintances.rec
     $ recsel -e "Dob >> '31 July 1994' && Dob << '01 August 1998'" \
       -p Name,Email acquaintances.rec
     Name: Charles Spencer
     Email: charlie@example.com

As you can see, there is only one such child in our record set.

   Note that the example command shown above contains both double quotes
'"' and single quotes '''.  The double quotes are interpreted by the
shell (e.g. 'bash') and the single quotes are interpreted by 'recsel',
defining a string.  (And the backslash is interpreted by the shell, the
usual continuation character so that this manual doesn't have a too-long
line.)

3.5.2 SEX Operands
------------------

The supported operands are: numbers, strings, field names and
parenthesized expressions.

3.5.2.1 Numeric Literals
........................

The supported numeric literals are integer numbers and real numbers.
The usual sign character '-' is used to denote negative values.  Integer
values can be denoted in base 10, base 16 using the '0x' prefix, and
base 8 using the '0' prefix.  Examples are:

     10000
     0
     0xFF
     -0xa
     012
     -07
     -1342
     .12
     -3.14

3.5.2.2 String Literals
.......................

String values are delimited by either the ''' character or the '"'
character.  Whichever delimiter is used, the delimiter closing the
literal must be the same as the delimiter used to open it.

   Newlines and tabs can be part of a string literal.

   Examples are:

     'Hello.'
     'The following example is the empty string.'
     ''

   The ''' and '"' characters can be part of a string if they are
escaped with a backslash, as in:

     'This string contains an apostrophe: \'.'
     "This one a double quote: \"."

3.5.2.3 Field Values
....................

The value of a field value can be included in a selection expression by
writing its name.  The field name is replaced by a string containing the
field value, to handle the possibility of records with more than one
field by that name.  Examples:

     Name
     Email
     long_field_name

   It is possible to use the role part of a field if it is not empty.
So, for example, if we are searching for the issues opened by 'John
Smith' in a database of issues we could write:

     $ recsel -e "OpenedBy = 'John Smith'"

instead of using a full field name:

     $ recsel -e "Hacker:Name:OpenedBy = 'John Smith'"

   When the name of a field appears in an expression, the expression is
applied to all the fields in the record featuring that name.  So, for
example, the expression:

     Email ~ "\\.org"

matches any record in which there is a field named 'Email' whose value
terminates in (the literal string) '.org'.  If we are interested in the
value of some specific email, we can specify its relative position in
the containing record by using "subscripts".  Consider, for example:

     Email[0] ~ "\\.org"

Will match for:

     Name: Mr. Foo
     Email: foo@foo.org
     Email: mr.foo@foo.com

But not for:

     Name: Mr. Foo
     Email: mr.foo@foo.com
     Email: foo@foo.org

   The regexp syntax supported in selection expressions is POSIX EREs,
with several GNU extensions.  *Note Regular Expressions::.

3.5.2.4 Parenthesized Expressions
.................................

Parenthesis characters ('(' and ')') can be used to group sub
expressions in the usual way.


File: recutils.info,  Node: SEX Operators,  Next: SEX Evaluation,  Prev: SEX Operands,  Up: Selection Expressions

3.5.3 Operators
---------------

The supported operators are arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division and modulus), logical operators, string
operators and field operators.

3.5.3.1 Arithmetic Operators
............................

Arithmetic operators for addition ('+'), subtraction ('-'),
multiplication ('*'), integer division ('/') and modulus ('%') are
supported with their usual meanings.

   These operators require either numeric operands or string operands
whose value can be interpreted as numbers (integer or real).

3.5.3.2 Boolean Operators
.........................

The boolean operators *and* ('&&'), *or* ('||') and *not* ('!') are
supported with the same semantics as their C counterparts.

   A compound boolean operator '=>' is also supported in order to ease
the elaboration of constraints in records: 'A => B', which can be read
as "A implies B", translates into '!A || (A && B)'.

   The boolean operators expect integer operands, and will try to
convert any string operand to an integer value.

3.5.3.3 Comparison Operators
............................

The compare operators *less than* ('<'), *greater than* ('>'), *less
than or equal* ('<='), *greater than or equal* ('>='), *equal* ('=') and
*unequal* ('!=') are supported with their usual meaning.

   Strings can be compared with the equality operator ('=').

   The match operator ('~') can be used to match a string with a given
regular expression (*note Regular Expressions::).

3.5.3.4 Date Comparison Operators
.................................

The compare operators *before* ('<<'), *after* ('>>') and *same time*
('==') can be used with fields and strings containing parseable dates.

   *Note Date input formats::.

3.5.3.5 Field Operators
.......................

Field counters are replaced by the number of occurrences of a field with
the given name in the record.  For example:

     #Email

   The previous expression is replaced with the number of fields named
'Email' in the record.  It can be zero if the record does not have a
field with that name.

3.5.3.6 String Operators
........................

The string concatenation operator ('&') can be used to concatenate any
number of strings and field values.

     'foo' & Name & 'bar'

3.5.3.7 Conditional Operator
............................

The ternary conditional operator can be used to select alternatives
based on the value of some expression:

     expr1 ? expr2 : expr3

   If 'expr1' evaluates to true (i.e. it is an integer or the string
representation of an integer and its value is not zero) then the
operator yields 'expr2'.  Otherwise it yields 'expr3'.

3.5.4 Evaluation of Selection Expressions
-----------------------------------------

Given that:

   - It is possible to refer to fields by name in selection expressions.
   - Records can have several fields with the same name.

It is clear that some backtracking mechanism is needed in the evaluation
of the selection expressions.  For example, consider the following
expression that is deciding whether a "registration" in a webpage should
be rejected:

     ((Email ~ "foomail\.com") || (Age <= 18)) && !#Fixed

   The previous expression will be evaluated for every possible
permutation of the fields "Email", "Age" and "Fixed" present in the
record, until one of the combinations succeeds.  At that point the
computation is interrupted.

   When used to decide whether a record matches some criteria, the goal
of a selection expression is to act as a boolean expression.  In that
case the final value of the expression depends on both the type and the
value of the result launched by the top-most subexpression:

   - If the result is an integer, the expression is true if its value is
     not zero.
   - If the result is a real, or a string, the expression evaluates to
     false.

   Sometimes a selection expression is used to compute a result instead
of a boolean.  In that case the returned value is converted to a string.
This is used when replacing the slots in templates (*note Templates::).

3.6 Field Expressions
=====================

"Field expressions" (also known as "fexes") are a way to select fields
of a record.  They also allow you to do certain transformations on the
selected fields, such as changing their names.

   A FEX comprises a sequence of "elements" separated by commas:

     ELEM_1,ELEM_2,...,ELEM_N

   Each element makes a reference to one or more fields in a record
identified by a given name and an optional subscript:

     FIELD_NAME[MIN-MAX]

MIN and MAX are zero-based indexes.  It is possible to refer to a field
occupying a given position.  For example, consider the following record:

     Name: Mr. Foo
     Email: foo@foo.com
     Email: foo@foo.org
     Email: mr.foo@foo.org

We would select all the emails of the record with:

     Email

The first email with:

     Email[0]

The third email with:

     Email[2]

The second and the third email with:

     Email[1-2]

   And so on.  It is possible to select the same field (or range of
fields) more than once just by repeating them in a field expression.
Thus, the field expression:

     Email[0],Name,Email

will print the first email, the name, and then all the email fields
including the first one.

   It is possible to include a "rewrite rule" in an element of a field
expression, which specifies an alias for the selected fields:

     FIELD_NAME[MIN-MAX]:ALIAS

For example, the following field expression specifies an alias for the
fields named 'Email' in a record:

     Name,Email:ElectronicMail

   Since the rewrite rules only affect the fields selected in a single
element of the field expression, it is possible to define different
aliases to several fields having the same name but occupying different
positions:

     Name,Email[0]:PrimaryEmail,Email[1]:SecondaryEmail

When that field expression is applied to the following record:

     Name: Mr. Foo
     Email: primary@email.com
     Email: secondary@email.com
     Email: other@email.com

the result will be:

     Name: Mr. Foo
     PrimaryEmail: primary@email.com
     SecondaryEmail: secondary@email.com
     Email: other@email.com

   It is possible to use the dot notation in order to refer to field and
sub-fields.  This is mainly used in the context of joins, where new
fields are created having compound names such as 'Foo_Bar'.  A reference
to such a field can be done in the fex using dot notation as follows:

     Foo.Bar

3.7 Sorted Output
=================

This special field sets sorting criteria for the records contained in a
record set.  Its usage is:

     %sort: FIELD1 FIELD2 ...

Meaning that the desired order for the records will be determined by the
contents of the fields named in the '%sort' value.  The sorting is
always done in ascending order, and there may be records that lack the
involved fields, i.e. the sorting fields need not be mandatory.

   It is an error to have more than one '%sort' field in the same record
descriptor, as only one field list can be used as sorting criteria.

   Consider for example that we want to keep the records in our
inventory system ordered by entry date.  We could achieve that by using
the following record descriptor in the database:

     %rec: Item
     %type: Date date
     %sort: Date

     Id: 1
     Title: Staplers
     Date: 10 February 2011

     Id: 2
     Title: Ruler Pack 20
     Date: 2 March 2009

     ...

As you can see in the example above, the fact we use '%sort' in a
database does not mean that the database will be always physically
ordered.  Unsorted record sets are not a data integrity problem, and
thus the diagnosis tools must not declare a recfile as +invalid because
of this.  The utility 'recfix' provides a way +to physically order the
fields in the file (*note Invoking recfix::).

   On the other hand any program listing, presenting or processing data
extracted from the recfile must honor the '%sort' entry.  For example,
when using the following 'recsel' program in the database above we would
get the output sorted by date:

     $ recsel inventory.rec
     Id: 2
     Title: Ruler Pack 20
     Date: 2 March 2009

     Id: 1
     Title: Staplers
     Date: 10 February 2011

The sorting of the selected field depends on its type:

   - Numeric fields (integers, ranges, reals) are numerically ordered.
   - Boolean fields are ordered considering that "false" values come
     first.
   - Dates are ordered chronologically.
   - Any other kind of field is ordered using a lexicographic order.

   It is possible to specify several fields as the sorting criteria.  In
that case the records are sorted using a lexicographic order.  Consider
for example the following unsorted database containing marks for several
students:

     %rec: Marks
     %type: Class enum A B C
     %type: Score real

     Name: Mr. One
     Class: C
     Score: 6.8

     Name: Mr. Two
     Class: A
     Score: 6.8

     Name: Mr. Three
     Class: B
     Score: 9.2

     Name: Mr. Four
     Class: A
     Score: 2.1

     Name: Mr. Five
     Class: C
     Score: 4

If we wanted to sort it by 'Class' and by 'Score' we would insert a
'%sort' special field in the descriptor, having:

     %rec: Marks
     %type: Class enum A B C
     %type: Score real
     %sort: Class Score

     Name: Mr. Four
     Class: A
     Score: 2.1

     Name: Mr. Two
     Class: A
     Score: 6.8

     Name: Mr. Three
     Class: B
     Score: 9.2

     Name: Mr. Five
     Class: C
     Score: 4

     Name: Mr. One
     Class: C
     Score: 6.8

The order of the fields in the '%sort' field is significant.  If we
reverse the order in the example above then we get a different sorted
set:

     %rec: Marks
     %type: Class enum A B C
     %type: Score real
     %sort: Score Class

     Name: Mr. Four
     Class: A
     Score: 2.1

     Name: Mr. Five
     Class: C
     Score: 4

     Name: Mr. Two
     Class: A
     Score: 6.8

     Name: Mr. One
     Class: C
     Score: 6.8

     Name: Mr. Three
     Class: B
     Score: 9.2

In this last case, 'Mr. One' comes after 'Mr. Two' because the class 'A'
comes before the class 'B' even though the score is the same ('6.8').

4 Editing Records
*****************

The simplest way of editing a recfile is to start your favourite text
editor and hack the contents of the file as desired.  However, the rec
format is structured enough so recfiles can be updated automatically by
programs.  This is useful for writing shell scripts or when there are
complex data integrity rules stored in the file that we want to be sure
to preserve.

   The following sections discuss the usage of the recutils for altering
recfiles in the level of record: adding new records, deleting or
commenting them out, sorting them, etc.

* Menu:

* Inserting Records::        Inserting data into recfiles.
* Deleting Records::         Removing data.
* Sorting Records::          Physical reordering of records.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Inserting Records,  Next: Deleting Records,  Up: Editing Records

4.1 Inserting Records
=====================

Adding new records to a recfile is pretty trivial: open it with your
text editor and just write down the fields comprising the records.  This
is really the best way to add contents to a recfile containing simple
data.  However, complex databases may introduce some difficulties:

_Multi-line values._
     It can be tedious to manually encode the several lines.
_Data integrity._
     It is difficult to manually maintain the integrity of data stored
     in the data base.
_Counters and timestamps._
     Some record sets feature auto-generated fields, which are commonly
     used to implement counters and time-stamps.  *Note Auto-Generated
     Fields::.

   Thus, to facilitate the insertion of new data a command line utility
called 'recins' is included in the recutils.  The usage of 'recins' is
very simple, and can be used both in the command line or called from
another program.  The following subsections discuss several aspects of
using this utility.

* Menu:

* Adding Records With recins::    Basics of the 'recins' utility.
* Replacing Records With recins:: Substituting records in a file.
* Adding Anonymous Records:: Inserting or replacing records with no
                              type.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Adding Records With recins,  Next: Replacing Records With recins,  Up: Inserting Records

4.1.1 Adding Records With recins
--------------------------------

Each invocation of 'recins' adds one record to the targeted database.
The fields comprising the records are specified using pairs of '-f' and
'-v' command line arguments.  For example, this is how we would add the
first entry to a previously empty contacts database:

     $ recins -f Name -v "Mr Foo" -f Email -v foo@bar.baz contacts.rec
     $ cat contacts.rec
     Name: Mr. Foo
     Email: foo@bar.baz

If we invoke 'recins' again on the same database we will be adding a
second record:

     $ recins -f Name -v "Mr Bar" -f Email -v bar@gnu.org contacts.rec
     $ cat contacts.rec
     Name: Mr. Foo
     Email: foo@bar.baz

     name: Mr. Bar
     Email: bar@gnu.org

   There is no limit on the number of '-f' '-v' pairs that can be
specified to 'recins', other than any limit on command line arguments
which may be imposed by the shell.

   The field values provided using '-v' are encoded to follow the rec
format conventions, including multi-line field values.  Consider the
following example:

     $ recins -f Name -v "Mr. Foo" -f Address -v '
     Foostrs. 19
     Frankfurt am Oder
     Germany' contacts.rec
     $ cat contacts.rec
     Name: Mr. Foo
     Address:
     + Foostrs. 19
     + Frankfurt am Oder
     + Germany

   It is also possible to provide fields already encoded as rec data for
their addition, using the '-r' command line argument.  This argument can
be intermixed with '-f' '-v'.

     $ recins -f Name -v "Mr. Foo" -r "Email: foo@bar.baz" contacts.rec
     $ cat contacts.rec
     Name: Mr. Foo
     Email: foo@bar.baz

   If the string passed to '-r' is not valid rec data then 'recins' will
complain with an error and the operation will be aborted.

   At this time, it is not possible to add new records containing
comments.

4.1.2 Replacing Records With recins
-----------------------------------

'recins' can also be used to replace existing records in a database with
a provided record.  This is done by specifying some criteria selecting
the record (or records) to be replaced.

   Consider for example the following command applied to our contacts
database:

     $ recins -e "Email = 'foo@bar.baz'" -f Name -v "Mr. Foo" \
         -f Email -v "new@bar.baz" contacts.rec

The contact featuring an email 'foo@bar.baz' gets replaced with the
following record:

     Name: Mr. Foo
     Email: new@bar.baz

   The records to be replaced can also be specified by index, or a range
of indexes.  For example, the following command replaces the first,
second and third records in a database with dummy records:

     $ recins -n 0,1-2 -f Dummy -v XXX foo.rec
     $ cat foo.rec
     Dummy: XXX

     Dummy: XXX

     Dummy: XXX

     ... Other records ...


File: recutils.info,  Node: Adding Anonymous Records,  Prev: Replacing Records With recins,  Up: Inserting Records

4.1.3 Adding Anonymous Records
------------------------------

In a previous chapter we noted that 'recsel' interprets the absence of a
'-t' argument depending on the actual contents of the file.  If the
recfile contains records of just one type the command assumes that the
user is referring to these records.

   'recins' does not follow this convention, and the absence of an
explicit type always means to insert (or replace) an anonymous record.
Consider for example the following database:

     %rec: Marks
     %type: Class enum A B C

     Name: Alfred
     Class: A

     Name: Bertram
     Class: B

If we want to insert a new mark we have to specify the type explicitly
using '-t':

     $ cat marks.rec | recins -t Marks -f Name -v Xavier -f Class -v C
     %rec: Marks
     %type: Class enum A B C

     Name: Alfred
     Class: A

     Name: Bertram
     Class: B

     Name: Xavier
     Class: C

If we forget to specify the type then an anonymous record is created
instead:

     $ cat marks.rec | recins -f Name -v Xavier -f Class -v C
     Name: Xavier
     Class: C

     %rec: Marks
     %type: Class enum A B C

     Name: Alfred
     Class: A

     Name: Bertram
     Class: B


File: recutils.info,  Node: Deleting Records,  Next: Sorting Records,  Prev: Inserting Records,  Up: Editing Records

4.2 Deleting Records
====================

Just as 'recins' inserts records, the utility 'recdel' deletes them.
Consider the following recfile 'stock.rec':
     %rec: Item
     %type: Expiry date
     %sort: Title

     Title: First Aid Kit
     Expiry: 2 May 2009

     Title: Emergency Rations
     Expiry: 10 August 2009

     Title: Life raft
     Expiry: 2 March 2009

   Suppose we wanted to delete all items with an 'Expiry' value before a
certain date, we could do this with the following command:

     $ recdel -t Item -e 'Expiry << "5/12/2009"' stock.rec
After running this command, only one record will remain in the file
(viz: the one titled 'Emergency Rations') because all the others have
expiry dates prior to 12 May 2009.  (1) The '-t' option can be omitted
if, and only if, there is no '%rec' field in the recfile.

   'recdel' tries to warn you if you attempt to perform a delete
operation which it deems to be too pervasive.  In such cases, it will
refuse to run, unless you give the '--force' flag.  However, you should
not rely upon 'recdel' to protect you, because it cannot always
correctly guess that you might be deleting more records than intended.
For this reason, it may be wise to use the '-c' flag, which causes the
relevant records to be commented out, rather than deleted.  (And of
course backups are always wise.)

   The complete options available to the 'recdel' command are explained
later.  *Note Invoking recdel::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) '5/12/2009' means the 12th day of May 2009, _not_ the fifth day
of December, even if your 'LC_TIME' environment variable has been set to
suggest otherwise.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Sorting Records,  Prev: Deleting Records,  Up: Editing Records

4.3 Sorting Records
===================

In the example above, note the existence of the '%sort: Title' line.
This field was discussed previously (*note Sorted Output::) and, as
mentioned, does not imply that the records need to be stored in the
recfile in any particular order.

   However, if desired, you can automatically arrange the recfile in
that order using 'recfix' with the '--sort' flag.  After running the
command
     $ recfix --sort stock.rec
the file 'stock.rec' will have its records sorted in alphabetical order
of the 'Title' fields, thus:
     %rec: Item
     %type: Expiry date
     %sort: Title

     Title: Emergency Rations
     Expiry: 10 August 2009

     Title: First Aid Kit
     Expiry: 2 May 2009

     Title: Liferaft
     Expiry: 2 March 2009

5 Editing Fields
****************

Fields of a recfile can, of course, be edited manually using an editor
and this is often the easiest way when only a few fields need to be
changed or when the nature of the changes do not follow any particular
pattern.  If, however, a large number of similar changes to several
records are required,the 'recset' command can make the job easier.

   The formal description of 'recset' is presented later (*note Invoking
recset::).  In this chapter some typical usage examples are discussed.
As with 'recdel', 'recset' if used erroneously has the potential to make
very pervasive changes, which could result in a large loss of data.  It
is prudent therefore to take a copy of a recfile before running such
commands.

* Renaming Fields::          Changing the name of a field.

5.1 Adding Fields
=================

As mentioned above, the command 'recins' adds new records to a recfile,
but it cannot add fields to an existing record.  This task can be
achieved automatically using 'recset' with its '-a' flag.

   Suppose that (after a stock inspection) you wanted to add an
'Inspected' field to all the items in the recfile.  The following
command could be used.
     $ recset -t Item -f Inspected -a 'Yes' stock.rec
Here, because no record selection flag was provided, the command
affected _all_ the records of type 'Item'.  We could limit the effect of
the command using the '-e', '-q', '-n' or '-m' flags.  For example to
add the 'Inspected' field to only the first item the following command
would work:
     $ recset -t Item -n 0 -f Inspected -a 'Yes' stock.rec
Similarly, a selection expression could have been used with the '-e'
flag in order to add the field only to records which satisfy the
expression.

   If you use 'recset' with the '-a' flag on a field that already
exists, a new field (in addition to those already present) will be
appended with the given value.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Setting Fields,  Next: Deleting Fields,  Prev: Adding Fields,  Up: Editing Fields

5.2 Setting Fields
==================

It is also possible to update the value of a field.  This is done using
'recset' with its '-s' flag.  In the previous example, an 'Inspected'
flag was added to certain records, with the value 'yes'.  After
reflection, one might want to record the date of inspection, rather than
a simple yes/no flag.  Records which have no such field will remain
unchanged.
     $ recset -t Item -f Inspected -s '30 October 2006' stock.rec
   Although the above command does not have any selection criteria, it
will only affect those records for which a 'Inspected' field exists.
This is because the '-s' flag only sets values of existing fields.  It
will not create any fields.

   If instead the '-S' flag is used, this will create the field (if it
does not already exist) _and_ set its value.
     $ recset -t Item -f Inspected -S '30 October 2006' stock.rec


File: recutils.info,  Node: Deleting Fields,  Next: Renaming Fields,  Prev: Setting Fields,  Up: Editing Fields

5.3 Deleting Fields
===================

You can delete fields using 'recset''s '-d' flag.  For example, if we
wanted to delete the 'Inspected' field which we introduced above, we
could do so as follows:
     $ recset -t Item -f Inspected -d stock.rec
This would delete _all_ fields named 'Inspected' from _all_ records of
type 'Item'.  It may be that, we only wanted to delete the 'Inspected'
fields from records which satisfy a certain condition.  The following
would delete the fields only from items whose 'Expiry' date was before 2
January 2010:
     $ recset -t Item -e 'Expiry << "2 January 2010"' -f Inspected -d stock.rec


File: recutils.info,  Node: Renaming Fields,  Prev: Deleting Fields,  Up: Editing Fields

5.4 Renaming Fields
===================

Another use of 'recset' is to rename existing fields.  This is achieved
using the '-r' flag.  To rename all instances of the 'Expiry' field
occurring in any record of type 'Item' to 'UseBy', the following command
suffices:
     $ recset -t Item -f Expiry -r 'UseBy' stock.rec
As with most operations, this could be done selectively, using the '-e'
flag and a selection expression.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Field Types,  Next: Constraints on Record Sets,  Prev: Editing Fields,  Up: Top

6 Field Types
*************

Field values are, by default, unrestricted text strings.  However, it is
often useful to impose some restrictions on the values of certain
fields.  For example, consider the following record:

     Id: 111
     Name: Jose E. Marchesi
     Age: 30
     MaritalStatus: single
     Phone: +49 666 666 66

   The values of the fields must clearly follow some structure in order
to make sense.  'Id' is a numeric identifier for a person.  'Name' will
never use several lines.  'Age' will typically be in the range '0..120',
and there are only a few valid values for 'MaritalStatus': single,
married, divorced, and widow(er).  Phones may be restricted to some
standard format as well to be valid.  All these restrictions (and many
others) can be enforced by using "field types".

   There are two kind of field types: "anonymous" and "named".  Those
are described in the following subsections.

* Menu:

* Declaring Types::          Declaration of types in record descriptors.
* Types and Fields::         Associating fields with types.
* Scalar Field Types::       Numbers and ranges.
* String Field Types::       Lines, limited strings and regular expressions.
* Enumerated Field Types::   Enumerations and boolean values.
* Date and Time Types::      Dates and times.
* Other Field Types::        Emails, fields, UUIDs, ...


File: recutils.info,  Node: Declaring Types,  Next: Types and Fields,  Up: Field Types

6.1 Declaring Types
===================

A type can be declared in a record descriptor by using the '%typedef'
special field.  The syntax is:

     %typedef: TYPE_NAME TYPE_DESCRIPTION

Where TYPE_NAME is the name of the new type, and TYPE_DESCRIPTION a
description which varies depending of the kind of type.  For example,
this is how a type 'Age_t' could be defined as numbers in the range
'0..120':

     %typedef: Age_t range 0 120

Type names are identifiers having the following syntax:

     [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*

Even though any identifier with that syntax could be used for types, it
is a good idea to consistently follow some convention to help
distinguishing type names from field names.  For example, the '_t'
suffix could be used for types.

   A type can be declared to be an alias for another type.  The syntax
is:

     %typedef: TYPE_NAME OTHER_TYPE_NAME

Where TYPE_NAME is declared to be a synonym of OTHER_TYPE_NAME.  This is
useful to avoid duplicated type descriptions.  For example, consider the
following example:

     %typedef: Id_t          int
     %typedef: Item_t        Id_t
     %typedef: Transaction_t Id_t

Both 'Item_t' and 'Transaction_t' are aliases for the type 'Id_t'.
Which is in turn an alias for the type 'int'.  So, they are both numeric
identifiers.

   The order of the '%typedef' fields is not relevant.  In particular, a
type definition can forward-reference another type that is defined
subsequently.  The previous example could have been written as:

     %typedef: Item_t        Id_t
     %typedef: Transaction_t Id_t
     %typedef: Id_t          int

Integrity check will complain if undefined types are referenced.  As
well as when any aliases up referencing back (looping back directly or
indirectly) in type declarations.  For example, the following set of
declarations contains a loop.  Thus, it's invalid:

     %typedef: A_t B_t
     %typedef: B_t C_t
     %typedef: C_t A_t

The scope of a type is the record descriptor where it is defined.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Types and Fields,  Next: Scalar Field Types,  Prev: Declaring Types,  Up: Field Types

6.2 Types and Fields
====================

Fields can be declared to have a given type by using the '%type' special
field in a record descriptor.  The synopsis is:

     %type: FIELD_LIST TYPE_NAME_OR_DESCRIPTION

Where FIELD_LIST is a list of field names separated by commas.
TYPE_NAME_OR_DESCRIPTION can be either a type name which has been
previously declared using '%typedef', or a type description.  Type names
are useful when several fields are declared to be of the same type:

     %typedef: Id_t    int
     %type:    Id      Id_t
     %type:    Product Id_t

Anonymous types can be specified by writing a type description instead
of a type name.  They help to avoid superfluous type declarations in the
common case where a type is used by just one field.  A record containing
a single 'Id' field, for example, can be defined without having to use a
'%typedef' in the following way:

     %rec: Task
     %type: Id int


File: recutils.info,  Node: Scalar Field Types,  Next: String Field Types,  Prev: Types and Fields,  Up: Field Types

6.3 Scalar Field Types
======================

The rec format supports the declaration of fields of the following
scalar types: integer numbers, ranges and real numbers.

   Signed "integers" are supported by using the 'int' declaration:

     %typedef: Id_t int

Given the declaration above, fields of type 'Id_t' must contain
integers, and they may be negative.  Hexadecimal values can be written
using the '0x' prefix, and octal values using an extra '0'.  Valid
examples are:

     %type: Id Id_t

     Id: 100
     Id: -23
     Id: -0xFF
     Id: 020

Sometimes it is desirable to reduce the "range" of integers allowed in a
field.  This can be achieved by using a range type declaration:

     %typedef: Interrupt_t range 0 15

Note that it is possible to omit the minimum index in ranges.  In that
case it is implicitly zero:

     %typedef: Interrupt_t range 15

It is possible to use the keywords 'MIN' and 'MAX' instead of a numeral
literal in one or both of the points conforming the range.  They mean
the minimum and the maximum integer value supported by the
implementation respectively.  See the following examples:

     %typedef: Negative range MIN -1
     %typedef: Positive range 0 MAX
     %typedef: AnyInt range MIN MAX
     %typedef: Impossible range MAX MIN

Hexadecimal and octal numbers can be used to specify the limits in a
range.  This helps to define scalar types whose natural base is not ten,
like for example:

     %typedef: Address_t range 0x0000 0xFFFF
     %typedef: Perms_t range 755

"Real" number fields can be declared with the 'real' type specifier.  A
wide range of real numbers can be represented this way, only limited by
the underlying floating point representation.  The decimal separator is
always the dot ('.') character regardless of the locale setting.  For
example:

     %typedef: Longitude_t real

Examples of fields of type real:

     %rec: Rectangle
     %typedef: Longitude_t real
     %type: Width  Longitude_t
     %type: Height Longitude_t

     Width: 25.01
     Height: 10

The 'line' field type specifier can be used to restrict the value of a
field to a single line, i.e. no newline characters are allowed.  For
example, a type for proper names could be declared as:

     %typedef: Name_t line

Examples of fields of type line:

     Name: Mr. Foo Bar
     Name: Mrs. Bar Baz
     Name: This is
     + invalid

Sometimes it is the maximum size of the field value that shall be
restricted.  The 'size' field type specifier can be used to define the
maximum number of characters a field value can have.  For example, if we
were collecting input that will get written in a paper-based forms
system allowing up to 25 characters width entries, we could declare the
entries as:

     %typedef: Address_t size 25

Note that hexadecimal and octal integer constants can also be used to
specify field sizes:

     %typedef: Address_t size 0x18

Arbitrary restrictions can be defined by using regular expressions.  The
"regexp" field type specifier introduces an ERE (extended regular
expression) that will be matched against fields having that name.  The
synopsis is:

     %typedef: TYPE_NAME regexp /RE/

where RE is the regular expression to match.

   For example, consider the 'Id_t' type designed to represent the
encoding of the identifier of ID cards in some country:

     %typedef: Id_t regexp /[0-9]{9}[a-zA-Z]/

Examples of fields of type 'Id_t' are:

     IDCard: 123456789Z
     IDCard: invalid id card

Note that the slashes delimiting the RE can be replaced with any other
character that is not itself used as part of the regexp.  That is useful
in some cases such as:

     %typedef: Path_t regexp |(/[^/]/?)+|

The regexp flavor supported in recfiles are the POSIX EREs plus several
GNU extensions.  *Note Regular Expressions::.

6.5 Enumerated Field Types
==========================

Fields of this type contain symbols taken from an enumeration.

   The type is described by writing the sequence of symbols comprising
the enumeration.  Enumeration symbols are strings described by the
following regexp:

     [a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*

The symbols are separated by blank characters (including newlines).  For
example:

     %typedef: Status_t enum NEW STARTED DONE CLOSED
     %typedef: Day_t enum Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
     +                    Saturday Sunday

It is possible to insert comments when describing an enum type.  The
comments are delimited by parenthesis pairs.  The contents of the
comments can be any character but parentheses.  For example:

     %typedef: TaskStatus_t enum
     + NEW         (The task was just created)
     + IN_PROGRESS (Task started)
     + CLOSED      (Task closed)

"Boolean" fields, declared with the type specifier 'bool', can be seen
as special enumerations holding the binary values true and false.

     %typedef: Yesno_t bool

The literals allowed in boolean fields are 'yes/no', '0/1' and
'true/false'.  Examples are:

     SwitchedOn: 1
     SwitchedOn: yes
     SwitchedOn: false


File: recutils.info,  Node: Date and Time Types,  Next: Other Field Types,  Prev: Enumerated Field Types,  Up: Field Types

6.6 Date and Time Types
=======================

The "date" field type specifier can be used to declare dates and times.
The synopsis is:

     %typedef: TYPE_NAME date

There are many permitted date formats, described in detail later in this
manual (*note Date input formats::).  Of particular note are the
following:
   - Dates and times read from recfiles are not affected by the locale
     or the timezone.  This means that the 'LC_TIME' and the 'TZ'
     environment variables are ignored.  If you wish, for example, to
     specify a time which must be interpreted as UTC, you must
     explicitly append the time zone correction: e.g. '2001-1-10
     12:09Z'.
   - The field value '1/10/2001' means January 10, 2001, *not* October
     1, 2001.
   - Relative times and dates (such as '1 day ago') are permitted but
     are not particularly useful.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Other Field Types,  Prev: Date and Time Types,  Up: Field Types

6.7 Other Field Types
=====================

The "Email" field type specifier is used to declare electronic
addresses.  The synopsis is:

     %typedef: Email_t email

Sometimes it is useful to make fields to store field names.  For that
purpose the "Field" field type specifier is supported.  The synopsis is:

     %typedef: Field_t field

Universally Unique Identifiers (also known as UUIDs) are a way to assign
a globally unique label to some object.  The "uuid" field type specifier
serves that purpose.  The synopsis is:

     %typedef: Id_t uuid

The format of the uuids is specified as 32 hexadecimal digits, displayed
in five groups separated by hyphens.  For example:

     550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

There is one other possible field type, viz: a foreign key.  The
following example defines the type 'Maintainer_t' to be of type "record
'Hacker'"; in other words, a foreign key referring to a record in the
'Hacker' record set.
     %typedef: Maintainer_t rec Hacker
This essentially means that the values to be stored in fields of type
'Maintainer_t' are of whatever type is defined for the primary key of
the 'Hacker' record set.  Why this is useful is discussed later.  *Note

7 Constraints on Record Sets
****************************

The records in a recfile are by default not restricted to any particular
structure except that they must contain one or more fields and optional
comments.  This provides the format with huge expressive power; but in
many cases, it is also desirable to impose some restrictions in order to
reflect some of the properties of the data stored in the database.  It
is also useful in order to preserve data integrity and thus avoid data
corruption.

   The following sections describe the usage of some predefined special
fields whose purpose is to impose this kind of restriction in the
structure of the records.

* Menu:

* Mandatory Fields::         Requiring the presence of fields.
* Prohibited Fields::        Forbidding the presence of fields.
* Allowed Fields::           Restricting the presence of fields.
* Keys and Unique Fields::   Fields characterizing records.
* Size Constraints::         Constraints on the number of records in a set.
* Arbitrary Constraints::    Constraints records must comply with.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Mandatory Fields,  Next: Prohibited Fields,  Up: Constraints on Record Sets

7.1 Mandatory Fields
====================

Sometimes, you want to make sure that _every_ record of a particular
type contains certain fields.  To do this, use the special field
'%mandatory'.  The usage is:

     %mandatory: FIELD1 FIELD2 ... FIELDN
The field names are separated by one or more blank characters.

   The fields listed in a '%mandatory' entry are non-optional; i.e. at
least one field with this name shall be present in any record of this
kind.  Records violating this restriction are invalid and a checking
tool will report the situation as a data integrity failure.

   Consider for example an "address book" database where each record
stores the information associated with a contact.  The records will be
heterogeneous, in the sense they won't all contain exactly the same
fields: the contact of an Internet shop will probably have a 'URL'
field, while the entry for our grandmother probably won't.  We still
want to make sure that every entry has a field with the name of the
contact.  In this case, we could use '%mandatory' as follows:

     %rec: Contact
     %mandatory: Name

     Name: Granny
     Phone: +12 23456677

     Name: Yoyodyne Corp.
     Email: sales@yoyod.com
     Phone: +98 43434433

   A word of caution, however: In many situations, especially in day to
day social interaction, it is common to find that certain information is
simply unavailable.  For example, although every person has a date of
birth, some people will refuse to provide that information.

   It is probably wise therefore to avoid stipulating a field as
mandatory, unless it is essential to the enterprise.  Otherwise, a data
entry clerk faced with this situation will have to make the choice
between dropping the entry entirely or entering some fake data to keep
the system happy.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Prohibited Fields,  Next: Allowed Fields,  Prev: Mandatory Fields,  Up: Constraints on Record Sets

7.2 Prohibited Fields
=====================

The inverse of '%mandatory' is '%prohibit'.  Prohibited fields may not
occur in _any_ record of the given type.  The usage is:

     %prohibit: FIELD1 FIELD2 ... FIELDN
The field names are separated by one or more blank characters.

Fields listed in a '%prohibit' entry are forbidden; i.e. no field with
this name should be present in any record of this kind.  Again, records
violating this restriction are invalid.

Several '%prohibit' fields can appear in the same record descriptor.
The set of prohibited fields is the union of all the entries.  For
example, in the following database both 'Id' and 'id' are prohibited:

     %rec: Entry
     %prohibit: Id
     %prohibit: id

   One possible use case for prohibited fields arises when some field
name is reserved for some future use.  For example, if we were
organizing a sports competition, we would want competitors to register
before the event.  However a competitor's 'result' should not and cannot
be entered before the competition takes place.  Initially then, we would
change the record descriptor as follows:

     %rec: Contact
     %mandatory: Name
     %prohibit: result
At the start of the event, the '%prohibit' line can be deleted, to allow
results to be entered.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Allowed Fields,  Next: Keys and Unique Fields,  Prev: Prohibited Fields,  Up: Constraints on Record Sets

7.3 Allowed Fields
==================

In some cases we know the set of fields that may appear in the records
of a given type, even if they are not mandatory.  The '%allowed' special
field is used to specify this restriction.  The usage is:

     %allowed: FIELD1 FIELD2 ... FIELDN
The field names are separated by one or more blank chracters.

If there are more or one '%allowed' fields in a record descriptor, all
fields of all the records in the record set must be in the union of
'%allowed', '%mandatory' and '%key'.  Otherwise an integrity error is
raised.

Several '%allowed' fields can appear in the same record descriptor.  The
set of allowed fields is the union of all the entries.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Keys and Unique Fields,  Next: Size Constraints,  Prev: Allowed Fields,  Up: Constraints on Record Sets

7.4 Keys and Unique Fields
==========================

The '%unique' and '%key' special fields are used to avoid several
instances of the same field in a record, and to implement keys in record
sets.  Their usage is:

     %unique: FIELD1 FIELD2 ... FIELDN
     %key: FIELD

The field names are separated by one or more blank characters.

   Normally it is permitted for a record to contain two or more fields
of the same name.  The '%unique' special field revokes this
permissiveness.  A field declared "unique" cannot appear more than once
in a single record.

   For example, an entry in an address book database could contain an
'Age' field.  It does not make sense for a single person to be of
several ages.  So, a field could be declared as "unique" in the
corresponding record descriptor as follows:

     %rec: Contact
     %mandatory: Name
     %unique: Age

Several '%unique' fields can appear in the same record descriptor.  The
set of unique fields is the union of all the entries.

   '%key' makes the referenced field the primary key of the record set.
The primary key behaves as if both '%unique' and '%mandatory' had been
specified for that field.  Additionally, there is further restriction,
viz: a given value of a primary key field may appear no more than once
within a record set.

   Consider for example a database of items in stock.  Each item is
identified by a numerical 'Id' field.  No item may have more than one
'Id', and no items may exist without an associated 'Id'.  Additionally,
no two items may share the same 'Id'.  This common situation can be
implementing by declaring 'Id' as the key in the record descriptor:

     %rec: Item
     %key: Id
     %mandatory: Title

     Id: 1
     Title: Box

     Id: 2
     Title: Sticker big

It would not make sense to have several primary keys in a record set.
Thus, it is not allowed to have several '%key' fields in the same record
descriptor.  It is also forbidden for two items to share the same 'Id'
value.  Both of these situations would be data integrity violations, and
will be reported by a checking tool.

   Elsewhere, we discuss how primary keys can be used to link one record
set to another using primary keys together with foreign keys.  *Note
Queries which Join Records::.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Size Constraints,  Next: Arbitrary Constraints,  Prev: Keys and Unique Fields,  Up: Constraints on Record Sets

7.5 Size Constraints
====================

Sometimes it is desirable to place constraints on entire records.  This
can be done with the '%size' special field which is used to limit the
number of records in a record set.  Its usage is:

     %size: [RELATIONAL_OPERATOR] NUMBER

If no operator is specified then NUMBER is interpreted as the exact
number of records of this type.  The number can be any integer literal,
including hexadecimal and octal constants.  For example:

     %rec: Day
     %size: 7
     %type: Name enum
     + Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
     + Saturday Sunday
     %doc: There should be exactly 7 days.

   The optional RELATIONAL_OPERATOR shall be one of '<', '<=', '>' and
'>='.  For example:

     %rec: Item
     %key: Id
     %size: <= 100
     %doc: We have at most 100 different articles.

   It is valid to specify a size of '0', meaning that no records of this
type shall exist in the file.

   Only one '%size' field shall appear in a record descriptor.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Arbitrary Constraints,  Prev: Size Constraints,  Up: Constraints on Record Sets

7.6 Arbitrary Constraints
=========================

Occasionally, '%mandatory', '%prohibit' and '%size' are just not
flexible enough.  We might, for instance, want to ensure that _if_ a
field is present, then it must have a certain relationship to other
fields.  Or we might want to stipulate that under certain conditions
only, a record contains a particular field.

   To this end, recutils provides a way for arbitrary field constraints
to be defined.  These permit restrictions on the presence and/or value
of fields, based upon the value or presence of other fields within that
record.  This is done using the '%constraint' special field.  Its usage
is:

     %constraint: EXPR

where EXPR is a selection expression (*note Selection Expressions::).
When a constraint is present in a record set it means that all the
records of that type must satisfy the selection expression, i.e. the
evaluation of the expression with the record returns 1.  Otherwise an
integrity error is raised.

   Consider for example a record type 'Task' featuring two fields of
type date called 'Start' and 'End'.  We can use a constraint in the
record set to specify that the task cannot start after it finishes:

     %rec: Task
     %type: Start,End date
     %constraint: Start << End

   The "implies" operator '=>' is especially useful when defining
constraints, since it can be used to specify conditional constraints,
i.e. constraints applying only in certain records.  For example, we
could specify that if a task is closed then it must have an 'End' date
in the following way:

     %rec: Task
     %type: Start,End date
     %constraint: Start << End
     %constraint: Status = 'CLOSED' => #End

   It is acceptable to declare several constraints in the same record
set.

8 Checking Recfiles
*******************

Sometimes, when creating a recfile by hand, typographical errors or
other mistakes will occur.  If a recfile contains such mistakes, then
one cannot rely upon the results of queries or other operations.
Fortunately there is a tool called 'recfix' which can find these errors.
It is a good idea to get into the habit of running 'recfix' on a file
after editing it, and before trying other commands.

* Menu:

* Syntactical Errors::  Fixing structure errors in recfiles.
* Semantic Errors::     Fixing semantic errors in recfiles.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Syntactical Errors,  Next: Semantic Errors,  Up: Checking Recfiles

8.1 Syntactical Errors
======================

One easy mistake is to forget the colon separating the field name from
its value.

     %rec: Article
     %key  Id

     Name: Thing
     Id:   0
Running 'recfix' on this file will immediately tell us that there is a
problem:

     $ recfix --check inventory.rec
     inventory.rec: 2: error: expected a record
Here, 'recfix' has diagnosed a problem in the file 'inventory.rec' and
the problem lies at line 2.  If, as in this case, 'recfix' shows there
is a problem with the recfile, you should attend to that problem before
trying to use any other recutils program on that file, otherwise strange
things could happen.  The '--check' flag is optional but in normal
execution not required because that is the default operation.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Semantic Errors,  Prev: Syntactical Errors,  Up: Checking Recfiles

8.2 Semantic Errors
===================

However 'recfix' checks more than the syntactical integrity of the
recfile.  It also checks certain semantics and that the data is
self-consistent.  To do this, it uses the special fields of the record,
some of which were introduced above (*note Constraints on Record
Sets::).  It is a good idea to use the special fields to stipulate the
"enterprise rules" of the data.

   Errors will be reported if any of the following special keywords are
present and the data does not match the stipulated conditions
'%mandatory'
     The mandated fields are missing from a record.
'%prohibit'
     The prohibited fields are present in a record.
'%unique'
     There is more than one field in a single record of the given name.
'%key'
     Two or more records share the same value of the field which is the
     key field.
'%typedef and %type'
     A field has a value which does not conform to the specified type.
'%size'
     The number of records does not conform to the specified
     restriction.
'%constraint'
     A field does not conform to the specified constraint.
'%confidential'
     An unencrypted value exists for a confidential field.

9 Remote Descriptors
********************

The '%rec' special field is used for two main purposes: to identify a
record as a record descriptor, and to provide a name for the described
record set.  The synopsis of the usage of the field is the following:

     %rec: TYPE [URL_OR_FILE]

TYPE is the name of the kind of records described by the descriptor.  It
is mandatory to specify it, and it follows the same lexical conventions
used by field names.  *Note Fields::.  There is a non-enforced
convention to use singular nouns, because the name makes reference to
the type of a single entity, even if it applies to all the records
contained in the record set.  For example, the following record set
contains transactions, and the type specified in the record descriptor
is 'Transaction'.

     %rec: Transaction

     Id: 10
     Title: House rent

     Id: 11
     Title: Loan

Only one '%rec' field should be in a record descriptor.  If there are
more it is an integrity violation.  It is highly recommended (but not
enforced) to place this field in the first position of the record
descriptor.

   Sometimes it is convenient to store records of the same type in
different files.  The duplication of record descriptors in this case
would surely lead to consistency problems.  A possible solution would be
to keep the record descriptor in a separated file and then include it in
any operation by using pipes.  For example:

     $ cat descriptor.rec data.rec | recsel ...

For those cases it is more convenient to use a "external descriptor".
External descriptors can be built appending a file path to the '%rec'
field value, like:

     %rec: FSD_Entry /path/to/file.rec

   The previous example indicates that a record descriptor describing
the 'FSD_Entry' records shall be read from the file '/path/to/file.rec'.
A record descriptor for 'FSD_Entry' may not exist in the external file.
Both relative and absolute paths can be specified there.

   URLs can be used as sources for external descriptors as well.  In
that case we talk about "remote descriptors".  For example:

     %rec: Department http://www.myorg.com/Org.rec

The URL shall point to a text file containing rec data.  If there is a
record descriptor in the remote file documenting the 'Department' type,
it will be used.

   Note that the local record descriptor can provide additional fields
to "expand" the record type.  For example:

     %rec: FSD_Entry http://www.jemarch.net/downloads/FSD.rec
     %mandatory: Rating

The record descriptor above is including the contents of the 'FSD_Entry'
record descriptor from the URL, and adding them to the local record
descriptor, that in this case contains just the '%mandatory' field.

   If you are using GNU recutils (*note Invoking the Utilities::) to
process your recfiles, any URL schema supported by 'libcurl' will work.

10.1 Grouping Records
=====================

Consider a recfile containing a list of items in a shop inventory.  For
each item it is stored its type, its category, its price, the date of
the last selling operation of an item of that type, and the amount of
items currently available in stock.  A sample of such a database could
be:

     Type: EC Car
     Category: Toy
     Price: 12.2
     LastSell: 20-April-2012
     Available: 623

     Type: Terria
     Category: Food
     Price: 0.60
     LastSell: 22-April-2012
     Available: 8239

     Type: Typex
     Category: Office
     Price: 1.20
     LastSell: 22-April-2012
     Available: 10878

     Type: Notebook
     Category: Office
     Price: 1.00
     LastSell: 21-April-2012
     Available: 77455

     Type: Sexy Puzzle
     Category: Toy
     Price: 6.20
     LastSell: 6.20
     Available: 12

Now imagine we are interested in grouping the contents of the 'Items'
record set in groups of items of the same category.  We can do it using
the '-G' command line argument for 'recsel'.  This argument accepts a
list of fields separated by commas.  The argument can be read as "group
by".

   In this case we want to group by 'Category', so we would do:

     $ recsel -G Category
     Type: Terria
     Category: Food
     Price: 0.60
     LastSell: 22-April-2012
     Available: 8239

     Type: Typex
     Category: Office
     Price: 1.20
     LastSell: 22-April-2012
     Available: 10878
     Type: Notebook
     Price: 1.00
     LastSell: 21-April-2012
     Available: 77455

     Type: EC Car
     Category: Toy
     Price: 12.2
     LastSell: 20-April-2012
     Available: 623
     Type: Sexy Puzzle
     Price: 6.20
     LastSell: 6.20
     Available: 12

We can see that the output is three records, corresponding to the three
different categories of items present in the database.  However, we are
only interested in the types of products in each category, so we can
remove unwanted information using '-p':

     $ recsel -G Category -p Category,Type items.rec
     Category: Food
     Type: Terria

     Category: Office
     Type: Typex
     Type: Notebook

     Category: Toy
     Type: EC Car
     Type: Sexy Puzzle

It is also possible to group by several fields.  We could group by both
'Category' and 'LastSell':

     $ recsel -G Category,LastSell -p Category,LastSell,Type items.rec
     Category: Food
     LastSell: 22-April-2012
     Type: Terria

     Category: Office
     LastSell: 21-April-2012

File: recutils.info,  Node: Aggregate Functions,  Prev: Grouping Records,  Up: Grouping and Aggregates

10.2 Aggregate Functions
========================

recutils supports "aggregate functions".  These are so called because
they accept a record set and a field name as inputs and generate a
single result.  Usually this result is numerical.

   The supported aggregate functions are the following:

'Count(FIELD)'
     Counts the number of occurrences of a field.
'Avg(FIELD)'
     Calculates the average (mean) of the numerical values of a field.
'Sum(FIELD)'
     Calculates the sum of the numerical values of a field.
'Min(FIELD)'
     Calculates the minimum numerical value of a field.
'Max(FIELD)'
     Calculates the maximum numerical value of a field.

   The aggregate functions are to be invoked in the field expressions in
'recsel'.  By default they are applied to the totality of the records in
a record set.  For example, using the items database from the previous
section, we can do calculations as in the following examples.

   The SQL aggregate functions can be applied to the totality of the
tuples in the relation.  For example, using the 'Count' aggregate
function we can calculate the number of fields named 'Category' present
in the record set as follows:

     $ recsel -p "Count(Category)" items.rec
     Count_Category: 5

The result is a field whose name is derived from the function name and
the field passed as its parameter, separated by an underline.  This name
scheme probably suffices for most purposes, but it is always possible to
use a rewrite rule to obtain something different:

     $ recsel -p "Count(Category):NumCategories" items.rec
     NumCategories: 5

You can use different letter case in writing the name of the aggregate,
and this will be reflected in the field name:

     $ recsel -p "CoUnT(Category)" items.rec
     CoUnT_Category: 5

It is possible to use more than one aggregate function in the field
expression.  Suppose we are also interested in the average price of the
items we sell.  We can use the 'Avg' aggregate:

     $ recsel -p "Count(Category),Avg(Price)" items.rec
     Count_Category: 5
     Avg_Price: 4.240000

Now let's add a field along with an aggregate function to the field
expression and see what we get:

     $ recsel -p "Type,Avg(Price)" items.rec
     Type: EC Car
     Avg_Price: 12.200000

     Type: Terria
     Avg_Price: 0.600000

     Type: Typex
     Avg_Price: 1.200000

     Type: Notebook
     Avg_Price: 1

     Type: Sexy Puzzle
     Avg_Price: 6.200000

We get five records!  The reason is that when _only_ aggregate functions
are part of the field expression, they are applied to the single record
that would result from concatenating all the records in the record set
together.  However, when a regular field appears in the field expression
the aggregate functions are applied to the individual records.  This is
still useful in some cases, such as a database of maintainers:

     Name: Jose E. Marchesi
     Email: jemarch@gnu.org
     Email: jemarch@es.gnu.org

     Name: Luca Saiu
     Email: positron@gnu.org

Lets see how many emails each maintainer has:

     $ recsel -p "Name,Count(Email)" maintainers.rec
     Name: Jose E. Marchesi
     Count_Email: 2

     Name: Luca Saiu
     Count_Email: 1

Aggregate functions are most useful when we combine them with grouping.
This is when we are interested in some property of a subset of the
records in the database.  For example, the average prices of each item
category stored in the database can be obtained by executing:

     $ recsel -p "Category,Avg(Price)" -G Category items.rec
     Category: Food
     Avg_Price: 0.600000

     Category: Office
     Avg_Price: 1.100000

     Category: Toy
     Avg_Price: 9.200000

If we were interested in the actual prices that result in each average
we can do:

     $ recsel -p "Category,Price,Avg(Price)" -G Category items.rec
     Category: Food
     Price: 0.60
     Avg_Price: 0.600000

     Category: Office
     Price: 1.20
     Price: 1.00
     Avg_Price: 1.100000

     Category: Toy
     Price: 12.2
     Price: 6.20
     Avg_Price: 9.200000

11 Queries which Join Records
*****************************

Suppose you wanted to add the residential address of the people in the
'acquaintances.rec' file from *note Simple Selections::.

   One way to do this is as follows:
     %type: Dob date

   This will work fine.  However you will notice that there are two
addresses where more than one person live (presumably they are members
of the same family).  This has a number of disadvantages:
   - You have to type (or copy) the same information several times.
   - Should a family move house, then you would have to update the
     addresses (and telephone number) of all the family members.
   - A typing error in one of the addresses would lead an automatic
     query to erroneously suggest that the people lived at different
     addresses.
   - It unnecessarily increases the size of the recfile.

11.1 Foreign Keys
=================

A better way would be to separate the addresses and people into
different record sets.  The first record set might look like this:

     %rec: Person
     %type: Dob date
     %type: Abode rec Residence


     Name: Alfred Nebel
     Dob: 20 April 2010
     Email: alf@example.com

     Abode: 2SerpeRise

     Name: Ernest Wright
     Dob: 26 April 1978
     Abode: ChezGrampa


and the second (following in the same file), like this:


     %rec: Residence
     %key: Id

     Address: 42 Abbeter Way, Inprooving, WORCS
     Telephone: 01234 5676789
     Id: 42AbbeterWay

     Address: 2 Serpe Rise, Little Worning, SURREY
     Telephone: 09876 5432109
     Id: 2SerpeRise

     Address: 1 Wanter Rise, Greater Inncombe, BUCKS
     Id: ChezGrampa

   Here you can see that there are two record sets viz: 'Person' and
'Residence'.  There are six people, but only three residences, because
some residences accommodate more than one person.  Note also that the
'Residence' descriptor has the entry '%key: Id' whilst the 'Person'
descriptor has '%type: Abode rec Residence'.  This is because 'Abode' is
the foreign key which identifies the residence where a person lives.

   We could have declared the 'Id' field as '%auto'.  This would have
had the advantage that we need not manually update it.  However, we
decided that the 'Abode' field values in the 'Person' records are better
as alphanumeric fields, so that they can contain human readable values.
In this way, it is self-evident by reading a 'Person' record where that
person lives.  Yet since the 'Id' field is declared using the '%key'
special field name, you can be sure that you don't accidentally reuse an
existing key.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Joining Records,  Prev: Foreign Keys,  Up: Queries which Join Records

11.2 Joining Records
====================

The above example has also added a new field to the 'Person' record set
to contain that person's mobile phone number.  Note that the 'Telephone'
field belongs to the 'Residence' record set because that contains the
telephone number of the home, whereas 'Mobile' belongs to 'Person' since
mobile telephones are normally used exclusively by one individual.

   If we want to look up the name and address of a person in our
recfile, we can use 'recsel' as before.  Because we now have more than
one record set in the 'acquaintances.rec' file, we have to tell 'recsel'
in which record set we want to look up records.  We do this with the
'-t' flag as follows:

     $ recsel -t Person -P Name,Abode acquaintances.rec
     Alfred Nebel
     42AbbeterWay

     Mandy Nebel
     42AbbeterWay

     Bertram Nebel
     42AbbeterWay

     Charles Spencer
     2SerpeRise

     Dirk Spencer
     2SerpeRise

     Ernest Wright
     ChezGrampa

   This result tells us the names of all the people in the recfile, as
well as giving a concise and hopefully effective reminder telling us
where they live.  However these results would not be useful to someone
unacquainted with the individuals.  They need a list of names and full
addresses.  We can use 'recsel' to produce such a list:

     $ recsel -t Person -j Abode acquaintances.rec
     Name: Charles Spencer
     Dob: 4 July 1997
     Email: charlie@example.com
     Abode_Address: 2 Serpe Rise, Little Worning, SURREY
     Abode_Telephone: 09876 5432109
     Abode_Id: 2SerpeRise

     Name: Dirk Spencer
     Dob: 29 June 1945
     Email: dirk@example.com
     Mobile: 0555 342123
     Abode_Address: 2 Serpe Rise, Little Worning, SURREY
     Abode_Telephone: 09876 5432109
     Abode_Id: 2SerpeRise

     Name: Ernest Wright
     Dob: 26 April 1978
     Abode_Address: 1 Wanter Rise, Greater Inncombe, BUCKS
     Abode_Id: ChezGrampa

   The '-t' flag we have seen before.  It tells 'recsel' that we want to
extract records of type 'Person'.  The '-j' flag is new.  It says that
we want to perform a "join".  Specifically we want to join the 'Person'
records according to their 'Abode' field.

   In the above example, 'recsel' displays several field names which do
not appear anywhere in the input e.g. 'Abode_Address'.  This is the
'Address' field in the record joined by the foreign key 'Abode'.  In
this example probably only the name and address are of interest.  The
other information such as date of birth is incidental.  The foreign key
'Abode_Id' is certainly not wanted in the output since it is redundant.
As usual, you can use the '-P' or '-p' options to limit the fields which
will be displayed.  However the full joined field name, if appropriate,
must be specified.  So the names and addresses without the other
information can be retrieved thus:

     $ recsel -t Person -j Abode -p Name,Abode_Address acquaintances.rec
     Name: Charles Spencer
     Abode_Address: 2 Serpe Rise, Little Worning, SURREY

     Name: Dirk Spencer
     Abode_Address: 2 Serpe Rise, Little Worning, SURREY

     Name: Ernest Wright
     Abode_Address: 1 Wanter Rise, Greater Inncombe, BUCKS

12 Auto-Generated Fields
************************

Consider for example a list of articles in stock in a toy store:

     %rec: Item
     %key: Description

     Description: 2cm metal soldier WWII
     Amount: 2111

     Description: Flying Helicopter Indoor Maxi
     Amount: 8

     ...

   It would be natural to identify the items by their descriptions, but
it is also error prone: was it "Flying Helicopter Indoor Maxi" or
"Flying Helicopter Maxi Indoor"?  Was "Helicopter" in lower case or
upper case?

   Thus it is quite common in databases to use some kind of numeric "Id"
to uniquely identify items like those ones, because numbers are easy to
increment and manipulate.  So we could add a new numeric 'Id' field and
use it as the primary key:

     %rec: Item
     %key: Id
     %mandatory: Description

     Id: 0
     Description: 2cm metal soldier WWII
     Amount: 2111

     Id: 1
     Description: Flying Helicopter Indoor Maxi
     Amount: 8

     ...

   A problem with this approach is that we must be careful to not assign
already used ids when we introduce more articles in the database.  Other
than its uniqueness, it is not important which number is associated with
which article.

   To ease the management of those Ids database systems use to provide a
facility called "auto-counters".  Auto-counters can be implemented in
recfiles using the '%auto' directive in the record descriptor.  Its
usage is:

     %auto: FIELD1 FIELD2 ... FIELDN

The list of field names are separated by one or more blank characters.
There can be several '%auto' fields in the same record descriptor, the
effective list of auto-generated fields being the union of all the
entries.

   When 'recins' inserts a new record in the recfile, it looks for any
declared auto field.  If any of these fields are not provided explicitly
in the command line then 'recins' generates them along with the
user-provided fields.  Such auto fields are generated at the beginning
of the new records, in the same order they are found in the '%auto'
directives.

   For example, consider a 'items.rec' database with an empty record
set:

     %rec: Item
     %key: Id
     %auto: Id
     %mandatory: Description

If we insert a new record and we do not specify an 'Id' then it will be
generated automatically by 'recins':

     $ recins -t Item -f Description -v 'recutils t-shirts' \
              -f Amount -v 200 \
              items.rec
     $ cat items.rec
     %rec: Item
     %key: Id
     %auto: Id
     %mandatory: Description

     Id: 0
     Description: recutils t-shirts
     Amount: 200

The concrete effect of the '%auto' directive depends on the type of the
affected field.  The following sections document how.

* Menu:

* Counters::                 Generating incremental Ids.
* Unique Identifiers::       Generating universally unique Ids.
* Time-Stamps::              Tracking the creation of records.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Counters,  Next: Unique Identifiers,  Up: Auto-Generated Fields

12.1 Counters
=============

If an auto field is of type 'integer' or 'range' then any newly
generated field will use the "next biggest" unused number in the record
set.

   Consider the toy inventory database introduced above.  We could
declare the 'Id' field to be generated automatically:

     %rec: Item
     %key: Id
     %type: Id int
     %mandatory: Description
     %auto: Id

     Id: 0
     Description: 2cm metal soldier WWII
     Amount: 2111

When the next new item is introduced in the database, 'recins' will note
the '%auto', and create a new 'Id' field for the new record with the
next-biggest unused integer, since 'Id' is declared to be of type 'int'.
In this example, the new record would have an Id of '1'.  The database
can still provide an explicit Id for the new record.  In that case the
field is not generated automatically.

   Note that if no explicit type is defined for an auto generated field
then it is assumed to be an integer.

12.2 Unique Identifiers
=======================

Universally Unique Identifiers, often abbreviated as UUIDs, can also be
auto-generated using recutils.  Suppose you maintain a database with
events featuring the following record descriptor:

     %rec: Event
     %key: Id
     %mandatory: Title Date

What would be appropriate to identify each event?  We could use an
integer and declare it as auto-generated.  After adding two events the
database would look like this:

     %rec: Event
     %key: Id
     %mandatory: Title Date

     Id: 0
     Title: Team meeting
     Date: 12-08-2013

     Id: 1
     Title: Dave's birthday
     Date: 20-12-2013

However, suppose that we want to share our events with other people,
i.e. to send them event records and to incorporate their records into
our own database.  In this case the 'Id's would collide.  A good
solution is to use 'uuids' and declare them as 'auto':

     %rec: Event
     %key: Id
     %type: Id uuid
     %mandatory: Title Date

     Id: f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6
     Title: Team meeting
     Date: 12-08-2013

     Id: f81d4fae-dc18-11d0-a765-a01328400a0c
     Title: Dave's birthday
     Date: 20-12-2013

12.3 Time-Stamps
================

Auto generated dates can be used to implement automatic timestamps.
Consider for example a "Transfer" record set registering bank transfers.
We want to save a timestamp every time a transfer is done, so we include
an '%auto' for the date:

     %rec: Transfer
     %key: Id
     %type: Id int
     %type: Date date
     %auto: Id Date

13 Encryption
*************

For ethical or security reasons it is sometimes necessary that
information in a recfile should not be readable by unauthorized people.
One way to prevent a recfile from being read is to use the security
features of the operating system.  A more secure way would be to encrypt
the entire recfile using a free strong encryption program such as GnuPG
(http://gnu.org/software/gnupg).  The disadvantage of both these methods
is that the entire recfile has to be secured when it may well be the
case that only certain data need to be protected.

   Recutils offers a way to encrypt specified fields in a record, whilst
leaving the rest in clear text.

* Menu:

* Confidential Fields::      Declaring fields as sensitive data.
* Encrypting Files::         Encrypt confidential fields.
* Decrypting Data::          Reading encrypted fields.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Confidential Fields,  Next: Encrypting Files,  Up: Encryption

13.1 Confidential Fields
========================

To specify that a field should be encrypted, use the '%confidential'
special field.  This special field declares a set of fields as
"confidential", meaning they contain secret data such as passwords or
personal information.  Its usage is:

     %confidential: FIELD1 FIELD2 ... FIELDN

The field names are separated by one or more blank characters.  There
can be several '%confidential' fields in the same record descriptor, the
effective list of confidential fields being the union of all the
entries.

   Declaring a field as confidential indicates that its contents must
not be stored in plain text, but encrypted with a password-based
mechanism.  When the information is retrieved from the database the
confidential fields are unencrypted if the correct password is provided.
Likewise, when information is inserted in the database the confidential
fields are encrypted with some given password.

   For example, consider a database of users of some service.  For each
user we want to store a name, a login name, an email address and a
password.  All this information is public with the obvious exception of
the password.  Thus we declare the 'Password' field as confidential in
the corresponding record descriptor:

     %rec: Account
     %type: Name line
     %type: Login line
     %type: Email email
     %confidential: Password

   The rec format does not impose the usage of a specific encryption
algorithm, but requires that:

   - The algorithm must be password-based.
   - The value of any encrypted field shall begin with the string
     'encrypted-' followed by the encrypted data.
   - The encrypted data must be encoded in some ASCII encoding such as
     base64.

   The above rules assure that it is possible to determine whether a
given field is encrypted.  For example, the following is an excerpt from
the account database described above.  It contains an entry with the
password encrypted and another with the password unencrypted:

     Name: Mr. Foo
     Login: foo
     Email: foo@foo.com
     Password: encrypted-AAABBBCCDDDEEEFFF

     Name: Mr. Bar
     Login: bar
     Email: bar@bar.com
     Password: secret

   Unencrypted confidential fields are a data integrity error, and
utilities like 'recfix' will report it.  The same utility can be used to
"fix" the database by massively encrypting any unencrypted field.

   Nothing prevents the usage of several passwords in the same database.
This allows the establishment of several level of securities or security
profiles.  For example, we may want to store different passwords for
different online services:

     %rec: Account
     %confidential: WebPassword ShellPassword

We could then encrypt WebPassword entries using a password shared among
all the webmasters, and the ShellPassword entries with a more restricted
password available only to the administrator of the machine.

   Note that since the utilities only accept to specify one password at
a time different passwords cannot be specified at decryption time.  This
means that in the example above the administrator would need to run
'recsel' twice in order to decrypt all the encrypted data in the
recfile.

   The GNU recutils fully support encrypted fields.  See the
documentation for 'recsel', 'recins' and 'recfix' for details on how to
operate on files containing confidential fields.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Encrypting Files,  Next: Decrypting Data,  Prev: Confidential Fields,  Up: Encryption

13.2 Encrypting Files
=====================

'recins' allows the insertion of encrypted fields in a database.  When
the '-s' ('--password') command line option is specified in the command
line any field declared as confidential in the record descriptor will
get encrypted using the given passphrase.  If the command is executed
interactively and '-s' is not used then the user is asked to provide a
password using the terminal.  For example, the invocation:

     $ recins -t Account -s mypassword -f Login -v foo -f Password  \
       -v secret accounts.rec

will encrypt the value of the 'Password' field with 'mypassword' as long
as the field is declared as confidential.  (*note Confidential Fields::
for details on confidential fields).

   'recins' will issue a warning if a confidential field is inserted in
the database but no password was provided to encrypt it.  This is to
avoid having unencrypted sensitive data in the recfiles.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Decrypting Data,  Prev: Encrypting Files,  Up: Encryption

13.3 Decrypting Data
====================

The contents of confidential fields can be read using the '-s'
('--password') command line option to 'recsel'.  When used, any selected
record containing encrypted fields will try to decrypt them with the
given password.  If the operation succeeds then the output will include
the unencrypted data.  Otherwise the ASCII-encoded encrypted data will
be emitted.

   If 'recsel' is invoked interactively and no password is specified
with '-s', the user will be asked for a password in case one is needed.
No echo of the password will appear in the screen.  The provided
password will be used to decrypt all confidential fields as if it was
specified with '-s'.

   For example, consider the following database storing information
about the user accounts of some online service.  Each entry stores a
login, a full name, email and a password.  The password is declared as
confidential:

     %rec: Account
     %key: Login
     %confidential: Password

     Login: foo
     Name: Mr. Foo
     Email: foo@foo.com
     Password: encrypted-AAABBBCCCDDD

     Login: bar
     Name: Ms. Bar
     Email: bar@bar.org
     Password: encrypted-XXXYYYZZZUUU

If we use 'recsel' to get a list of records of type 'Account' without
specifying a password, or if the wrong password was specified in
interactive mode, then we would get the following output with the
encrypted values:

     $ cat accounts.rec | recsel -t Account -p Login,Password
     Login: foo
     Password: encrypted-AAABBBCCCDDD

     Login: bar
     Password: encrypted-XXXYYYZZZUUU

If we specify a password and both entries were encrypted using that
password, we would get the unencrypted values:

     $ recsel -t Account -s secret -p Login,Password accounts.rec
     Login: foo
     Password: foosecret

     Login: bar
     Password: barsecret

   As mentioned above, a confidential field may be encrypted with
different passwords in different records (*note Confidential Fields::).
For example, we may have an entry in our database with data about the
account of the administrator of the online service.  In that case we
might want to store the password associated with that account using a
different password than that for users.  In that case the output of the
last command would have been:

     $ recsel -t Account -s secret -p Login,Password accounts.rec
     Login: foo
     Password: foosecret

     Login: bar
     Password: barsecret

     Login: admin
     Password: encrypted-TTTVVVBBBNNN

We would need to invoke 'recsel' with the password used to encrypt the
admin entry in order to read it back unencrypted.

Having a list of names and addresses, one might want to use this list to

are normally written on several lines, it would be appropriate then to
split the 'Address' field values across multiple lines as described in
*note Fields::.  Suitable text can now be obtained thus:

     $ recsel -t Person -j Abode -P Name,Abode_Address acquaintances.rec
     Charles Spencer
     2 Serpe Rise,
     Little Worning,
     SURREY

     Dirk Spencer
     2 Serpe Rise,
     Little Worning,
     SURREY

     Ernest Wright
     1 Wanter Rise,
     Greater Inncombe,
     BUCKS

   A business enterprise might want to go one step further and generate
letters (such as an advertisement or a recall notice) to customers.
Since 'recsel' merely selects records and fields from record sets, on
its own it cannot do this; so there is another command designed for this
purpose, called 'recfmt'.  This command uses a "template" which defines
the general form of the desired output.  A letter template might look as
follows:
     {{Name}}
     {{Abode_Address}}

     Dear {{Name}},

          Re: Special offer for January

     We are delighted to be able to offer you a 95% discount on all car and
     truck hire contracts between 1 January and 2 February.  Please call us
     to take advantage of this offer.

   It is best to place such a template into a file, so that you can edit
it as you wish.  Notice the instances of double braces enclosing a field
name, e.g. '{{Name}}'.  These are called "spots" and indicate places
where the respective field's value should be placed.  Let's assume this
template is in a file called 'offer.templ'.  We can then pipe the output
from 'recsel' into 'recfmt' in order as follows:

     $ recsel -t Person -j Abode acquaintances.rec | recfmt -f offer.templ

14.1 Templates
==============

A recfmt template is a text string that may contain "template spots".
Those spots are substituted in the template using the information of a
given record.  Any text that is not within a spot is copied literally to
the output.

   Spots are written surrounded by double curly braces, like:

     {{...}}

   Spots contain selection expressions, that are executed every time the
template is applied to a record.  The spot is then replaced by the
string representation of the value returned by the expression.

   For example, consider the following template:

     Task {{Id}}: {{Summary}}
     ------------------------
     {{Description}}
     --
     Created at {{CreatedAt}}

When applied to the following record:

     Id: 123
     Summary: Fix recfmt.
     CreatedAt: 12 December 2010
     Description:
     + The recfmt tool shall be fixed, because right
     + now it is leaking 200 megabytes per processed record.

The result is:

     Task 123: Fix recfmt.
     ------------------------
     The recfmt tool shall be fixed, because right
     now it is leaking 200 megabytes per processed record.
     --
     Created at 12 December 2010

   You can use any selection expression in the slots, including
conditionals and string concatenation.

15 Interoperability
*******************

Included in the recutils package are a number of utilities to assist in
the creation of recfiles using data which already exists in other
formats, and for exporting data from recfiles so that it can be used in
other applications.

* Menu:

* CSV Files::                Converting recfiles to/from csv files.
* Importing MDB Files::      Importing MS Access Databases.


File: recutils.info,  Node: CSV Files,  Next: Importing MDB Files,  Up: Interoperability

15.1 CSV Files
==============

Many applications are able to read and write files containing so-called
"comma separated values".  Such files generally contain tabular data
where the columns are separated by commas and the rows by line feed
and/or carriage return characters.  Although record sets are not tables,
tables can be easily emulated using records having the same fields in
the same order.  For example:

     a: value
     b: value
     c: value

     a: value
     b: value
     c: value

     ...

   In several respects records are more flexible than tables:

   - Fields can appear in a different order in several records.
   - There can be several fields with the same name in a single record.
   - Records can differ in the number of fields.

   It is evident that records, such as those in recfiles, are a more
general structure than comma separated values.  This means that when
converting from csv files to recfiles, certain decisions need to be
made.  The 'rec2csv' utility (*note Invoking rec2csv::) implements an
algorithm to deal with this problem and generate a table that the user
expects.

   The algorithm works as follows:

  1. The utility first scans the specified record set, building a list
     with the names that will become the table header.

  2. For each field, a header is added with the form:

          FIELDNAME[_N]

     where N is a number in the range '2..inf' and is the "index" of the
     field in its containing record plus one.  For example, consider the
     following record set:

          a: a1
          b: b11
          b: b12
          c: c1

          a: a2
          b: b2
          d: d2

     The corresponding list of headers being:

          a b b_2 c a b d

  3. Then duplicates are removed:

          a b b_2 c d

  4. The resulting list of headers is then used to build the table in
     the generated csv file.

   In the above example the result would be

     "a","b","b_2","c","d"
     "a1","b11","b12","c1",
     "a2","b2",,,"d2"

   As shown, missing fields are implemented as empty columns in the
generated csv.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Importing MDB Files,  Prev: CSV Files,  Up: Interoperability

15.2 Importing MDB Files
========================

Access files ("mdb files") are collections of several relations, also
known as tables.  Tables can be either "user tables" storing user data,
or "system tables" storing information such as forms, queries or the
relationships between the tables.

   It is possible to get a listing with the names of all tables stored
in a mdb file by calling 'mdb2rec' in the following way:

     $ mdb2rec -l sales.mdb
     Customers
     Products
     Orders

   So 'sales.mdb' stores user information in the tables Customers,
Products and Orders.  If we want to include system tables in the listing
we can use the '-s' command line option:

     $ mdb2rec -s -l sales.mdb
     MSysObjects
     MSysACEs
     MSysQueries
     MSysRelationships
     Customers
     Products
     Orders

   The tables with names starting with 'MSys' are system tables.  The
data stored in those tables is either not relevant to the recutils user
(used by the Access program to create forms and the like) or is used in
an indirect way by 'mdb2rec' (such as the information from
MSysRelationships).

   Let's read some data from the 'mdb' file.  We can get the relation of
Products in rec format:

     $ mdb2rec sales.mdb Products
     %rec: Products
     %type: ProductID int
     %type: ProductName size 80
     %type: Discontinued bool

     ProductID: 1
     ProductName: GNU generation T-shirt
     Discontinued: 0

     ...

   A "record descriptor" is created for the record set containing the
generated records, called Products.  As seen in the example, 'mdb2rec'
is able to generate type information for the fields.  The list of
customers is similar:

     $ mdb2rec sales.mdb Customers
     %rec: Customers
     %type: CustomerID size 4
     %type: CompanyName size 80
     %type: ContactName size 60

     CustomerID: GSOFT
     CompanyName: GNU Soft
     ContactName: Jose E. Marchesi

     ...

   If no table is specified in the invocation to 'mdb2rec' all the
tables in the file are processed, with the exception of the system
tables, which requires '-s' to be used:

     $ mdb2rec sales.mdb
     %rec: Products
     ...

     %rec: Customers
     ...

     %rec: Orders
     ...

16 Bash Builtins
****************

The command-line utilities described in *note Invoking the Utilities::
are designed to be used interactively in the shell.  Together, and often
combined with the standard shell utilities, they provide a quite
complete user interface.  However, the user's experience can be greatly
improved by a closer integration between the recutils and the shell.
The following sections describe several extensions for 'bash', the GNU
shell (*note (bash)Top::).  These extensions make the shell "aware" of
the recutils.

   As with any bash built-in, help is available in the command line
using the 'help' command.  For example:

     $ help readrec

   If you installed recutils using a binary package in a GNU/Linux
distribution, odds are that the built-in commands described in this
chapter are already available to you.  Otherwise (you get a "command not
found" or similar error) you may have to register the built-in commands
with your bash.  This is very easy using the 'enable' bash command.  The
registering command for readrec would be:

     $ enable -f readrec.so readrec

   Note however that some systems require the full path to 'readrec.so'
in order for this command to work.

* Menu:

* readrec::                  Exporting the contents of records to the shell.


File: recutils.info,  Node: readrec,  Up: Bash Builtins

16.1 readrec
============

The bash built-in 'read', when invoked with no options, consumes one
line from standard input and makes it available in the predefined
'REPLY' environment variable, or any other variable whose name is passed
as an argument.  This allows processing data structured in lines in a
quite natural way.  For example, the following program prints the third
field of each line, with fields separated by commas, until standard
input is exhausted:

     # Process one line at a time.
     while read
     do
       echo "The third field is " `echo $REPLY | cut -d, -f 2`
     done

   However, 'read' is not very useful when it comes to processing
recutils records in the shell.  Even though it is possible to customize
the character used by 'read' to split the input into records, we would
need to ignore the empty records in the likely case of more than one
empty line separating records.  Also, we would need to use 'recsel' to
access to the record fields.  Too complicated!

   Thus, the 'readrec' bash built-in is similar to 'read' with the
difference that it reads records instead of lines.  It also "exports"
the contents of the record to the user as the values of several
environment variables:

   - 'REPLY_REC' is set to the record read from standard input.
   - A set of variables 'FIELD' named after each field found in the
     record are set to the (decoded) value of the fields found in the
     input record.  When several fields with the same name are found in
     the input record then a bash array is created.

   Consider for example the following simple database containing
contacts information:

     Name: Mr. Foo
     Email: foo@bar.com
     Email: bar@baz.net
     Checked: no

     Name: Mr. Bar
     Email: bar@foo.com
     Telephone: 999666000
     Checked: yes

We would like to write some shell code to send an email to all the
contacts, but only if the contact has not been checked before, i.e. the
'Checked' field contains 'no'.  The following code snippet would do the
job nicely using 'readrec':

     recsel contacts.rec | while readrec
     do
        if [ $Checked = "no" ]
        then
           mail -s "You are being checked." ${Email[0]} < email.txt
           recset -e "Email = '$Email'" -f Checked -S yes contacts.rec
           sleep 1
        fi
     done

Note the usage of the bash array when accessing the primary email
address of each contact.  Note also that we update each contact to
figure as "checked", using 'recset', so she won't get pestered again the
next time the script is run.

File: recutils.info,  Node: Invoking recinf,  Next: Invoking recsel,  Up: Invoking the Utilities

17.1 Invoking recinf
====================

'recinf' reads the given rec files (or the data from standard input if
no file is specified) and prints a summary of the record types contained
in the input.

   Synopsis:

     recinf [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   The default behavior is to emit a line per record type in the input
containing its name and the number of records of that type:

     $ recinf hackers.rec tasks.rec
     25 Hacker
     102 Task

   If the input contains anonymous records, i.e. records that are before
the first record descriptor, the corresponding output line won't have a
type name:

     $ recinf data.rec
     10

   In addition to the common options described earlier the program
accepts the following options.

'-t TYPE'
'--type=TYPE'
     Select records of a given type only.
'-d'
'--descriptor'
     Print all the record descriptors present in the file.
'-n'
'--names-only'
     Output just the names of the record types found in the input.  If
     the input contains only anonymous records then output nothing.
'-S'
'--print-sexps'
     Print the data in the form of sexps (Lisp expressions) instead of
     rec format.  This option can be useful for, of course, Lisp
     programs.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Invoking recsel,  Next: Invoking recins,  Prev: Invoking recinf,  Up: Invoking the Utilities

17.2 Invoking recsel
====================

'recsel' reads the given rec files (or the data in the standard input if
no file is specified) and prints out records (or part of records) based
upon some criteria specified by the user.

   'recsel' searches rec files for records satisfying certain criteria.
Synopsis:

     recsel [OPTION]... \
            [-n INDEXES | -e RECORD_EXPR | -q STR | -m NUM] \
            [-c | (-p|-P|-R) FIELD_EXPR] \
            [FILE]...

   If no FILE is specified then the command acts like a filter, getting
the data from standard input and writing the result to standard output.

   In addition to the common options described earlier (*note Common
Options::) the program accepts the following options.

The following "global options" are available.

'-i'
'--case-insensitive'
     Make string matching case-insensitive in selection expressions.
'-C'
'--collapse'
     Do not section the result in records with newlines.
'-d'
'--include-descriptors'
     Print record descriptors along with the matched records.
'-s SECRET'
'--password=SECRET'
     Try to decrypt confidential fields with the given password.
'-S'
'--sort=FIELDS'
     Sort the output by the comma-separated list of field names, FIELDS.
     This option takes precedence over any sorting criteria specified in
     the corresponding record descriptor with '%sort'.
'-U'
'--uniq'
     Remove duplicated fields in the output records.  Fields are
     duplicated if they have the same field name and the same value.
'-G'
'--group-by=FIELDS'
     Group the output records by the provided comma-separated list of
     FIELDS.  Grouping is performed before sorting.

   The "selection options" are used to select a subset of the records in
the input.

'-n INDEXES'
'--number=INDEXES'
     Match the records occupying the given positions in its record set.
     INDEXES must be a comma-separated list of numbers or ranges, with
     ranges being two numbers separated with dashes.  For example, the
     following list denotes the first, the third, the fourth and all
     records up to the tenth: '-n 0,2,4-9'.
'-e EXPR'
'--expression=EXPR'
     A record selection expression (*note Selection Expressions::).
     Only the records matched by the expression will be taken into
     account to compute the output.
'-q STR'
'--quick=STR'
     Select records having a field whose value contains the substring
     STR.
'-m NUM'
'--random=NUM'
     Select NUM random records.  If NUM is zero then select all the
     records.
'-t TYPE'
'--type=TYPE'
     Select records of a given type only.
'-j FIELD'
'--field=FIELD'
     Perform an inner join of the record set selected by '-t' and the
     record set for which FIELD is a foreign key.  FIELD must be a field
     declared with type 'rec' and thus must be a foreign key.  If a join
     is performed then any selection expression and field expression
     operate on the joined record sets.

   The "output options" are used to determine what information about the
selected records to display to the user, and how to display it.

'-p NAME_LIST'
'--print=NAME_LIST'
     List of fields to print for each record.  NAME_LIST is a list of
     field names separated by commas.  For example:
          -p Name,Email

     means to print the Name and the Email of every matching record,
     both the field names and values.

     If this option is not specified then all the fields of the matching
     records are printed to standard output.
'-P NAME_LIST'
'--print-values=NAME_LIST'
     Same as '-p', but print only the values of the selected fields.
'-R NAME_LIST'
'--print-row=NAME_LIST'
     Same as '-P', but print the values separated by single spaces
     instead of newlines.
'-c'
'--count'
     If this option is specified then 'recsel' will print the number of
     matching records instead of the records themselves.  This option is
     incompatible with '-p', '-P' and '-R'.

   This "special option" is available to ease the communication between
the recutils and other programs, namely Lisp interpreters.  This option
is not intended to be used by human operators.

'--print-sexps'
     Print the data using sexps instead of rec format.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Invoking recins,  Next: Invoking recdel,  Prev: Invoking recsel,  Up: Invoking the Utilities

17.3 Invoking recins
====================

'recins' adds new records to a rec file or to rec data read from
standard input.  Synopsis:

     recins [OPTION]... [-t TYPE] \
            [-n INDEXES | -e RECORD_EXPR | -q STR | -m NUM] \
            [( -f STR -v STR]|[-r RECDATA )]... \
            [FILE]

   The new record to be inserted by the command is constructed by using
pairs of '-f' and '-v' options, or '-r'.  Each pair defines a field.
The order of the parameters is significant.

   If no FILE is specified then the command acts like a filter, getting
the data from standard input and writing the result to standard output.

   If the specified FILE does not exist, it is created.

   In addition to the common options described earlier (*note Common
Options::) the program accepts the following options.

'-t'
'--type=EXPR'
     The type of the new record.  If there is a record set in the input
     data matching this type then the new record is added there.
     Otherwise a new record set is created.  If this parameter is not
     specified then the new record is anonymous.
'-f'
'--field=NAME'
     Declares the name of a field.  This option must be followed by a
     '-v'.
'-v'
'--value=VALUE'
     The value of the field being defined.
'-r'
'--record=VALUE'
     Add the fields of the record in VALUE.  This option can be
     intermixed with '-f ... -v' pairs.
'-s'
'--password'
     Encrypt confidential fields with the given password.
'--no-external'
     Don't use external record descriptors.
'--verbose'
     Be verbose when reporting integrity problems.
'--no-auto'
     Don't generate "auto" fields.  *Note Auto-Generated Fields::.

   Record selection arguments are supported too.  If they are used then
'recins' uses "replacement mode": instead of appending the new record,
matched records are replaced by copies of the provided record.  The
selection arguments are the same as in 'recsel':

'-n INDEXES'
'--number=INDEXES'
     Match the records occupying the given positions in its record set.
     INDEXES must be a comma-separated list of numbers or ranges, the
     ranges being two numbers separated with dashes.  For example, the
     following list denotes the first, the third, the fourth and all
     records up to the tenth: '-n 0,2,4-9'.
'-e RECORD_EXPR'
'--expression=EXPR'
     A record selection expression (*note Selection Expressions::).
     Matching records will get replaced.
'-q STR'
'--quick=STR'
     Remove records having a field whose value contains the substring
     STR.
'-m NUM'
'--random=NUM'
     Select NUM random records.  If NUM is zero then all records are
     selected, i.e. no replace mode is activated.
'-i'
'--case-insensitive'
     Make strings case-insensitive in selection expressions.
'--force'
     Insert the requested record even in potentially dangerous
     situations, such as when the data integrity of the database is
     compromised.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Invoking recdel,  Next: Invoking recset,  Prev: Invoking recins,  Up: Invoking the Utilities

17.4 Invoking recdel
====================

'recdel' removes records from a rec file, or from rec data read from
standard input.  Synopsis:

     recdel [OPTIONS]... [-t TYPE] \
            [-n INDEXES | -e RECORD_EXPR | -q STR | -m NUM] \
            [FILE]

   If no FILE is specified then the command acts like a filter, getting
the data from standard input and writing the result to standard output.

   In addition to the common options described earlier (*note Common
Options::) the program accepts the following options.

'-t'
'--type=EXPR'
     Remove records of the given type.  If this parameter is not
     specified then records of any type will be removed.
'-n INDEXES'
'--number=INDEXES'
     Match the records occupying the given positions in its record set.
     INDEXES must be a comma-separated list of numbers or ranges, the
     ranges being two numbers separated with dashes.  For example, the
     following list denotes the first, the third, the fourth and all
     records up to the tenth: '-n 0,2,4-9'.
'-e RECORD_EXPR'
'--expression=EXPR'
     A record selection expression (*note Selection Expressions::).
     Only the records matched by the expression will be removed from the
     file.
'-q STR'
'--quick=STR'
     Remove records having a field whose value contains the substring
     STR.
'-m NUM'
'--random=NUM'
     Remove NUM random records.  If NUM is zero then remove all the
     records.
'-c'
'--comment'
     Comment the matching records out instead of removing them.
'--force'
     Delete even in potentially dangerous situations, such as a request
     to delete all the records of some type.
'--no-external'
     Don't use external record descriptors.
'-i'
'--case-insensitive'
     Make strings case-insensitive in selection expressions.
'--verbose'
     Be verbose when reporting integrity problems.

17.5 Invoking recset
====================

'recset' manipulates the fields of records in a rec file, or rec data
read from standard input.  Synopsis:

     recset [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   If no FILE is specified then the command acts like a filter, getting
the data from standard input and writing the result to standard output.

   In addition to the common options described earlier (*note Common

   Record selection options:

'-i'
'--case-insensitive'
     Make strings case-insensitive in selection expressions.
'-t'
'--type=EXPR'
     Operate on the records of the given type.  If this parameter is not
     specified then records of any type will be affected.
'-n INDEXES'
'--number=INDEXES'
     Operate on the records occupying the given positions in its record
     set.  INDEXES must be a comma-separated list of numbers or ranges,
     the ranges being two numbers separated with dashes.  For example,
     the following list denotes the first, the third, the fourth and all
     records up to the tenth: '-n 0,2,4-9'.
'-e EXPR'
'--expression=EXPR'
     A record selection expression (*note Selection Expressions::).
     Only the records matched by the expression will be processed.
'-q STR'
'--quick=STR'
     Operate on records having a field whose value contains the
     substring STR.
'-m NUM'
'--random=NUM'
     Operate on NUM random records.  If NUM is zero then operate on all
     the records.

   Field selection options:

'-f'
'--fields=FEX'
     Field selection expression (*note Field Expressions::) to select
     the fields to operate.

   Actions:

'-s'
'--set=VALUE'
     Set the value of the selected fields to VALUE.
'-a'
'--add=VALUE'
     Add a new field to the selected record with value VALUE.
'-S'
'--set-add=VALUE'
     Set the value of the selected fields to VALUE.  If some of the
     fields don't exist in a record, append it with the specified value.
'-r'
'--rename=VALUE'
     Rename a field; VALUE must be a valid field name.  The field
     expression associated with this action must contain a single field
     name and an optional subscript.  If an entire record set is
     selected then the field is renamed in the record descriptor as
     well.
'-d'
'--delete'
     Delete the selected fields in the selected records.
'-c'
'--comment'
     Comment out the selected fields in the selected records.
'--no-external'
     Don't use external record descriptors.
'--verbose'
     Be verbose when reporting integrity problems.
'--force'
     Perform the requested operation even in potentially dangerous
     situations, or when the integrity of the data stored in the file is
     affected.

17.6 Invoking recfix
====================

'recfix' checks and fixes rec files.  Synopsis:

     recfix [OPTION]... [OPERATION] [OP_OPTION]... [FILE]

   If no FILE is specified then the command acts like a filter, getting
the data from standard input and writing the result to standard output.

   In addition to the common options described earlier (*note Common
Options::) the program accepts the following global options.

'--no-external'
     Don't use external record descriptors.

   The effect of running 'recfix' depends on the operation it performs.
The operation mode is selected by using one of the following options.

'--check'
     Check the integrity of the database contained in the file, printing
     diagnostics messages in case something is not right.  This is the
     default operation.
'--sort'
     Perform a physical sort of all the records contained in the file
     (or standard input) after checking for its integrity.  The sorting
     criteria are provided by the '%sort' special field, if any.  If
     there is an integrity failure the sorting is not performed.

     This is a destructive operation.
'--decrypt'
'--encrypt'
     Decrypt (encrypt) all the (non-)encrypted fields in the database
     which are marked as confidential.  This operation requires a
     password.  If no password is specified with '-s' and the program is
     run in a terminal, a prompt is given to get the password from the
     user.

     If encryption is performed on a file having encrypted fields, the
     operation will fail unless '--force' is used.

     These are destructive operations.
'--auto'
     Insert auto-generated fields as appropriate in the records which
     are missing them.

     This is a destructive operation.

   As described above, some operations make use of these additional
options:

'-s SECRET'
'--password=SECRET'
     Password used to encrypt or decrypt fields.
'--force'
     Force potentially dangerous operations.

'csv2rec' reads the given comma-separated-values file (or the data from
standard input if no file is specified) and prints out the converted rec
data, if possible.  Synopsis:

     csv2rec [OPTION]... [CSV_FILE]

   In addition to the common options described earlier (*note Common
Options::) the program accepts the following options.

'-t TYPE'
'--type=TYPE'
     Type of the converted records.  If no type is specified then no
     type is used.
'-s'
'--strict'
     Be strict parsing the csv file.
'-e'
'--omit-empty'
     Omit empty fields.

17.9 Invoking rec2csv
=====================

'rec2csv' reads the given rec files (or the data in the standard input
if no file is specified) and prints out the converted
comma-separated-values.  Synopsis:

     rec2csv [OPTION]... [REC_FILE]...

   The rec data can be read from files specified in the command line, or
from standard input.  The program writes the converted data to standard
output.

   In addition to the common options described earlier (*note Common
Options::) the program accepts the following options.

'-t TYPE'
'--type=TYPE'
     Type of the records to convert.  If no type is specified then the
     default records (with no name) are converted.
'-S'
'--sort=FIELDS'
     Sort the output by the comma-separated list of field names FIELDS.
     This option has precedence to whatever sorting criteria are
     specified in the corresponding record descriptor with '%sort'.
'-d'
'--delim=CHAR'
     Use CHAR as the delimiter character separating fields in the
     output.  Defaults to ','.

18 Regular Expressions
**********************

The character '.' matches any single character except the null
character.

'+'
     match one or more occurrences of the previous atom or regexp.
'?'
     match zero or one occurrences of the previous atom or regexp.
'\+'
     matches a '+'
'\?'
     matches a '?'.

   Bracket expressions are used to match ranges of characters.  Bracket
expressions where the range is backward, for example '[z-a]', are
invalid.  Within square brackets, '\' is taken literally.  Character
classes are supported; for example '[[:digit:]]' matches a single
decimal digit.

   GNU extensions are supported:
'\w'
     matches a character within a word
'\W'
     matches a character which is not within a word
'\<'
     matches the beginning of a word
'\>'
     matches the end of a word
'\b'
     matches a word boundary
'\B'
     matches characters which are not a word boundary
'\`'
     matches the beginning of the whole input
'\''
     matches the end of the whole input

   Grouping is performed with parentheses '()'.  An unmatched ')'
matches just itself.  A backslash followed by a digit acts as a
back-reference and matches the same thing as the previous grouped
expression indicated by that number.  For example, '\2' matches the
second group expression.  The order of group expressions is determined
by the position of their opening parenthesis '('.

   The alternation operator is '|'.

   The characters '^' and '$' always represent the beginning and end of
a string respectively, except within square brackets.  Within brackets,
an initial '^' inverts the character class being matched.

   '*', '+' and '?' are special at any point in a regular expression
except the following places, where they are not allowed:
  1. At the beginning of a regular expression
  2. After an open-group, '('
  3. After the alternation operator, '|'

   Intervals are specified by '{' and '}'.  Invalid intervals such as
'a{1z' are not accepted.

   The longest possible match is returned; this applies to the regular
expression as a whole and (subject to this constraint) to
sub-expressions within groups.

First, a quote:

     Our units of temporal measurement, from seconds on up to months,
     are so complicated, asymmetrical and disjunctive so as to make
     coherent mental reckoning in time all but impossible.  Indeed, had
     some tyrannical god contrived to enslave our minds to time, to make
     it all but impossible for us to escape subjection to sodden
     routines and unpleasant surprises, he could hardly have done better
     than handing down our present system.  It is like a set of
     trapezoidal building blocks, with no vertical or horizontal
     surfaces, like a language in which the simplest thought demands
     ornate constructions, useless particles and lengthy
     circumlocutions.  Unlike the more successful patterns of language
     and science, which enable us to face experience boldly or at least
     level-headedly, our system of temporal calculation silently and
     persistently encourages our terror of time.

     ... It is as though architects had to measure length in feet, width
     in meters and height in ells; as though basic instruction manuals
     demanded a knowledge of five different languages.  It is no wonder
     then that we often look into our own immediate past or future, last
     Tuesday or a week from Sunday, with feelings of helpless confusion.
     ...

19.1 General date syntax
========================

A "date" is a string, possibly empty, containing many items separated by
whitespace.  The whitespace may be omitted when no ambiguity arises.
The empty string means the beginning of today (i.e., midnight).  Order
of the items is immaterial.  A date string may contain many flavors of
items:

   * calendar date items
   * time of day items
   * time zone items
   * combined date and time of day items
   * day of the week items
   * relative items
   * pure numbers.

We describe each of these item types in turn, below.

   A few ordinal numbers may be written out in words in some contexts.
This is most useful for specifying day of the week items or relative
items (see below).  Among the most commonly used ordinal numbers, the
word 'last' stands for -1, 'this' stands for 0, and 'first' and 'next'
both stand for 1.  Because the word 'second' stands for the unit of time
there is no way to write the ordinal number 2, but for convenience
'third' stands for 3, 'fourth' for 4, 'fifth' for 5, 'sixth' for 6,
'seventh' for 7, 'eighth' for 8, 'ninth' for 9, 'tenth' for 10,
'eleventh' for 11 and 'twelfth' for 12.

   When a month is written this way, it is still considered to be
written numerically, instead of being "spelled in full"; this changes
the allowed strings.

   In the current implementation, only English is supported for words
and abbreviations like 'AM', 'DST', 'EST', 'first', 'January', 'Sunday',
'tomorrow', and 'year'.

   The output of the 'date' command is not always acceptable as a date
string, not only because of the language problem, but also because there
is no standard meaning for time zone items like 'IST'.  When using
'date' to generate a date string intended to be parsed later, specify a
date format that is independent of language and that does not use time
zone items other than 'UTC' and 'Z'.  Here are some ways to do this:

     $ LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC0 date
     Mon Mar  1 00:21:42 UTC 2004
     $ TZ=UTC0 date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%SZ'
     2004-03-01 00:21:42Z
     $ date --rfc-3339=ns  # --rfc-3339 is a GNU extension.
     2004-02-29 16:21:42.692722128-08:00
     $ date --rfc-2822  # a GNU extension
     Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800
     $ date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'  # %z is a GNU extension.
     2004-02-29 16:21:42 -0800
     $ date +'@%s.%N'  # %s and %N are GNU extensions.
     @1078100502.692722128

   Alphabetic case is completely ignored in dates.  Comments may be
introduced between round parentheses, as long as included parentheses
are properly nested.  Hyphens not followed by a digit are currently
ignored.  Leading zeros on numbers are ignored.

   Invalid dates like '2005-02-29' or times like '24:00' are rejected.
In the typical case of a host that does not support leap seconds, a time
like '23:59:60' is rejected even if it corresponds to a valid leap
second.

19.2 Calendar date items
========================

A "calendar date item" specifies a day of the year.  It is specified
differently, depending on whether the month is specified numerically or
literally.  All these strings specify the same calendar date:

     1972-09-24     # ISO 8601.
     72-9-24        # Assume 19xx for 69 through 99,
                    # 20xx for 00 through 68.
     72-09-24       # Leading zeros are ignored.
     9/24/72        # Common U.S. writing.
     24 September 1972
     24 Sept 72     # September has a special abbreviation.
     24 Sep 72      # Three-letter abbreviations always allowed.
     Sep 24, 1972
     24-sep-72
     24sep72

   The year can also be omitted.  In this case, the last specified year
is used, or the current year if none.  For example:

     9/24
     sep 24

   Here are the rules.

   For numeric months, the ISO 8601 format 'YEAR-MONTH-DAY' is allowed,
where YEAR is any positive number, MONTH is a number between 01 and 12,
and DAY is a number between 01 and 31.  A leading zero must be present
if a number is less than ten.  If YEAR is 68 or smaller, then 2000 is
added to it; otherwise, if YEAR is less than 100, then 1900 is added to
it.  The construct 'MONTH/DAY/YEAR', popular in the United States, is
accepted.  Also 'MONTH/DAY', omitting the year.

   Literal months may be spelled out in full: 'January', 'February',
'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September',
'October', 'November' or 'December'.  Literal months may be abbreviated
to their first three letters, possibly followed by an abbreviating dot.
It is also permitted to write 'Sept' instead of 'September'.

   When months are written literally, the calendar date may be given as
any of the following:

     DAY MONTH YEAR
     DAY MONTH
     MONTH DAY YEAR
     DAY-MONTH-YEAR

   Or, omitting the year:

     MONTH DAY


File: recutils.info,  Node: Time of day items,  Next: Time zone items,  Prev: Calendar date items,  Up: Date input formats

19.3 Time of day items
======================

A "time of day item" in date strings specifies the time on a given day.
Here are some examples, all of which represent the same time:

     20:02:00.000000
     20:02
     8:02pm
     20:02-0500      # In EST (U.S. Eastern Standard Time).

   More generally, the time of day may be given as 'HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND',
where HOUR is a number between 0 and 23, MINUTE is a number between 0
and 59, and SECOND is a number between 0 and 59 possibly followed by '.'
or ',' and a fraction containing one or more digits.  Alternatively,
':SECOND' can be omitted, in which case it is taken to be zero.  On the
rare hosts that support leap seconds, SECOND may be 60.

   If the time is followed by 'am' or 'pm' (or 'a.m.' or 'p.m.'), HOUR
is restricted to run from 1 to 12, and ':MINUTE' may be omitted (taken
to be zero).  'am' indicates the first half of the day, 'pm' indicates
the second half of the day.  In this notation, 12 is the predecessor of
1: midnight is '12am' while noon is '12pm'.  (This is the zero-oriented
interpretation of '12am' and '12pm', as opposed to the old tradition
derived from Latin which uses '12m' for noon and '12pm' for midnight.)

   The time may alternatively be followed by a time zone correction,
expressed as 'SHHMM', where S is '+' or '-', HH is a number of zone
hours and MM is a number of zone minutes.  The zone minutes term, MM,
may be omitted, in which case the one- or two-digit correction is
interpreted as a number of hours.  You can also separate HH from MM with
a colon.  When a time zone correction is given this way, it forces
interpretation of the time relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),
overriding any previous specification for the time zone or the local
time zone.  For example, '+0530' and '+05:30' both stand for the time
zone 5.5 hours ahead of UTC (e.g., India).  This is the best way to
specify a time zone correction by fractional parts of an hour.  The
maximum zone correction is 24 hours.

   Either 'am'/'pm' or a time zone correction may be specified, but not
both.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Time zone items,  Next: Combined date and time of day items,  Prev: Time of day items,  Up: Date input formats

19.4 Time zone items
====================

A "time zone item" specifies an international time zone, indicated by a
small set of letters, e.g., 'UTC' or 'Z' for Coordinated Universal Time.
Any included periods are ignored.  By following a non-daylight-saving
time zone by the string 'DST' in a separate word (that is, separated by
some white space), the corresponding daylight saving time zone may be
specified.  Alternatively, a non-daylight-saving time zone can be
followed by a time zone correction, to add the two values.  This is
normally done only for 'UTC'; for example, 'UTC+05:30' is equivalent to
'+05:30'.

   Time zone items other than 'UTC' and 'Z' are obsolescent and are not
recommended, because they are ambiguous; for example, 'EST' has a
different meaning in Australia than in the United States.  Instead, it's
better to use unambiguous numeric time zone corrections like '-0500', as
described in the previous section.

   If neither a time zone item nor a time zone correction is supplied,
timestamps are interpreted using the rules of the default time zone
(*note Specifying time zone rules::).

19.5 Combined date and time of day items
========================================

The ISO 8601 date and time of day extended format consists of an ISO
8601 date, a 'T' character separator, and an ISO 8601 time of day.  This
format is also recognized if the 'T' is replaced by a space.

   In this format, the time of day should use 24-hour notation.
Fractional seconds are allowed, with either comma or period preceding
the fraction.  ISO 8601 fractional minutes and hours are not supported.
Typically, hosts support nanosecond timestamp resolution; excess
precision is silently discarded.

   Here are some examples:

     2012-09-24T20:02:00.052-05:00
     2012-12-31T23:59:59,999999999+11:00
     1970-01-01 00:00Z

19.6 Day of week items
======================

The explicit mention of a day of the week will forward the date (only if
necessary) to reach that day of the week in the future.

   Days of the week may be spelled out in full: 'Sunday', 'Monday',
'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday' or 'Saturday'.  Days may be
abbreviated to their first three letters, optionally followed by a
period.  The special abbreviations 'Tues' for 'Tuesday', 'Wednes' for
'Wednesday' and 'Thur' or 'Thurs' for 'Thursday' are also allowed.

   A number may precede a day of the week item to move forward
supplementary weeks.  It is best used in expression like 'third monday'.
In this context, 'last DAY' or 'next DAY' is also acceptable; they move
one week before or after the day that DAY by itself would represent.

   A comma following a day of the week item is ignored.


File: recutils.info,  Node: Relative items in date strings,  Next: Pure numbers in date strings,  Prev: Day of week items,  Up: Date input formats

19.7 Relative items in date strings
===================================

"Relative items" adjust a date (or the current date if none) forward or
backward.  The effects of relative items accumulate.  Here are some
examples:

     1 year
     1 year ago
     3 years
     2 days

   The unit of time displacement may be selected by the string 'year' or
'month' for moving by whole years or months.  These are fuzzy units, as
years and months are not all of equal duration.  More precise units are
'fortnight' which is worth 14 days, 'week' worth 7 days, 'day' worth 24
hours, 'hour' worth 60 minutes, 'minute' or 'min' worth 60 seconds, and
'second' or 'sec' worth one second.  An 's' suffix on these units is
accepted and ignored.

   The unit of time may be preceded by a multiplier, given as an
optionally signed number.  Unsigned numbers are taken as positively
signed.  No number at all implies 1 for a multiplier.  Following a
relative item by the string 'ago' is equivalent to preceding the unit by
a multiplier with value -1.

   The string 'tomorrow' is worth one day in the future (equivalent to
'day'), the string 'yesterday' is worth one day in the past (equivalent
to 'day ago').

   The strings 'now' or 'today' are relative items corresponding to
zero-valued time displacement, these strings come from the fact a
zero-valued time displacement represents the current time when not
otherwise changed by previous items.  They may be used to stress other
items, like in '12:00 today'.  The string 'this' also has the meaning of
a zero-valued time displacement, but is preferred in date strings like
'this thursday'.

   When a relative item causes the resulting date to cross a boundary
where the clocks were adjusted, typically for daylight saving time, the
resulting date and time are adjusted accordingly.

   The fuzz in units can cause problems with relative items.  For
example, '2003-07-31 -1 month' might evaluate to 2003-07-01, because
2003-06-31 is an invalid date.  To determine the previous month more
reliably, you can ask for the month before the 15th of the current
month.  For example:

     $ date -R
     Thu, 31 Jul 2003 13:02:39 -0700
     $ date --date='-1 month' +'Last month was %B?'
     Last month was July?
     $ date --date="$(date +%Y-%m-15) -1 month" +'Last month was %B!'
     Last month was June!

   Also, take care when manipulating dates around clock changes such as
daylight saving leaps.  In a few cases these have added or subtracted as
much as 24 hours from the clock, so it is often wise to adopt universal
time by setting the 'TZ' environment variable to 'UTC0' before embarking

19.8 Pure numbers in date strings
=================================

The precise interpretation of a pure decimal number depends on the
context in the date string.

   If the decimal number is of the form YYYYMMDD and no other calendar
date item (*note Calendar date items::) appears before it in the date
string, then YYYY is read as the year, MM as the month number and DD as
the day of the month, for the specified calendar date.

   If the decimal number is of the form HHMM and no other time of day
item appears before it in the date string, then HH is read as the hour
of the day and MM as the minute of the hour, for the specified time of
day.  MM can also be omitted.

   If both a calendar date and a time of day appear to the left of a
number in the date string, but no relative item, then the number
overrides the year.

19.9 Seconds since the Epoch
============================

If you precede a number with '@', it represents an internal timestamp as
a count of seconds.  The number can contain an internal decimal point
(either '.' or ','); any excess precision not supported by the internal
representation is truncated toward minus infinity.  Such a number cannot
be combined with any other date item, as it specifies a complete
timestamp.

   Internally, computer times are represented as a count of seconds
since an epoch--a well-defined point of time.  On GNU and POSIX systems,
the epoch is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, so '@0' represents this time, '@1'
represents 1970-01-01 00:00:01 UTC, and so forth.  GNU and most other
POSIX-compliant systems support such times as an extension to POSIX,
using negative counts, so that '@-1' represents 1969-12-31 23:59:59 UTC.

   Traditional Unix systems count seconds with 32-bit two's-complement
integers and can represent times from 1901-12-13 20:45:52 through
2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC.  More modern systems use 64-bit counts of
seconds with nanosecond subcounts, and can represent all the times in
the known lifetime of the universe to a resolution of 1 nanosecond.

   On most hosts, these counts ignore the presence of leap seconds.  For
example, on most hosts '@915148799' represents 1998-12-31 23:59:59 UTC,
'@915148800' represents 1999-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, and there is no way to
represent the intervening leap second 1998-12-31 23:59:60 UTC.

19.10 Specifying time zone rules
================================

Normally, dates are interpreted using the rules of the current time
zone, which in turn are specified by the 'TZ' environment variable, or
by a system default if 'TZ' is not set.  To specify a different set of
default time zone rules that apply just to one date, start the date with
a string of the form 'TZ="RULE"'.  The two quote characters ('"') must
be present in the date, and any quotes or backslashes within RULE must
be escaped by a backslash.

   For example, with the GNU 'date' command you can answer the question
"What time is it in New York when a Paris clock shows 6:30am on October
31, 2004?"  by using a date beginning with 'TZ="Europe/Paris"' as shown
in the following shell transcript:

     $ export TZ="America/New_York"
     $ date --date='TZ="Europe/Paris" 2004-10-31 06:30'
     Sun Oct 31 01:30:00 EDT 2004

   In this example, the '--date' operand begins with its own 'TZ'
setting, so the rest of that operand is processed according to
'Europe/Paris' rules, treating the string '2004-10-31 06:30' as if it
were in Paris.  However, since the output of the 'date' command is
processed according to the overall time zone rules, it uses New York
time.  (Paris was normally six hours ahead of New York in 2004, but this
example refers to a brief Halloween period when the gap was five hours.)

   A 'TZ' value is a rule that typically names a location in the 'tz'
database (http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm).  A recent catalog of
location names appears in the TWiki Date and Time Gateway
(http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/xtra/tzdate).  A few non-GNU hosts require a
colon before a location name in a 'TZ' setting, e.g.,
'TZ=":America/New_York"'.

   The 'tz' database includes a wide variety of locations ranging from
'Arctic/Longyearbyen' to 'Antarctica/South_Pole', but if you are at sea
and have your own private time zone, or if you are using a non-GNU host
that does not support the 'tz' database, you may need to use a POSIX
rule instead.  Simple POSIX rules like 'UTC0' specify a time zone
without daylight saving time; other rules can specify simple daylight
saving regimes.  *Note Specifying the Time Zone with 'TZ': (libc)TZ
Variable.

19.11 Authors of 'parse_datetime'
=================================

'parse_datetime' started life as 'getdate', as originally implemented by
Steven M. Bellovin (<smb@research.att.com>) while at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The code was later tweaked by a couple
of people on Usenet, then completely overhauled by Rich $alz
(<rsalz@bbn.com>) and Jim Berets (<jberets@bbn.com>) in August, 1990.
Various revisions for the GNU system were made by David MacKenzie, Jim
Meyering, Paul Eggert and others, including renaming it to 'get_date' to
avoid a conflict with the alternative Posix function 'getdate', and a
later rename to 'parse_datetime'.  The Posix function 'getdate' can
parse more locale-specific dates using 'strptime', but relies on an
environment variable and external file, and lacks the thread-safety of
'parse_datetime'.

   This chapter was originally produced by Franc,ois Pinard
(<pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>) from the 'parse_datetime.y' source code, and
then edited by K. Berry (<kb@cs.umb.edu>).

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
